Also, this allows LazySizes to take the image source in order to request it when scrolled into view.</li>\n<li>Add a class of <code>lazyload</code> to the image, so LazySizes knows it has to act on that element.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Here’s a quick demo, scroll to make images appear. You can check the network tab on the browser’s DevTools and you’ll see image requests being done as you scroll!</p>\n<p>SImple image lazyloading with LazySizes.</p>\n<hr>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"1 Minute To Become A Better Developer (#20)","spoiler":"Learn how to lazy load images, in one minute.","date":"2021-03-23T14:17:37.750Z"}},"previous":{"slug":"1-minute-to-become-a-better-developer-19","frontmatter":{"title":"1 Minute To Become A Better Developer (#19)","spoiler":"Learn how to use RegEx Lazy Quantifier, in one minute.","date":"2021-03-19T13:26:48.884Z"}},"next":{"slug":"master-git-diff-with-these-not-so-known-commands","frontmatter":{"title":"Master Git Diff With These Not-So-Known Commands","spoiler":"Save time while reviewing your own pull requests","date":"2021-03-24T13:59:13.304Z"}}},"__N_SSG":true}
