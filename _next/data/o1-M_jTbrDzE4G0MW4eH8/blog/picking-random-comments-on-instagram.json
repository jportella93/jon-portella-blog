{"pageProps":{"post":{"slug":"picking-random-comments-on-instagram","content":"<p><img src=\"./images/i-loor-nicolas.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>So this friend of mine, who is a personal trainer, has a bussiness Instagram account. He did a contest where any follower could comment a picture of his to have a chance to win a pack of training equipment.</p>\n<p>The comment needed to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Include the phrase 'I participate'.</li>\n<li>Mention 3 other users.</li>\n<li>Also, only one comment per user was allowed.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A problem arised when, after more than 200 people commented, he had to, somehow, randomly pick a comment that also passed these conditions.</p>\n<p>So I did a quick search for available options and I didn't find anything acceptable. Some were <a href=\"https://www.easypromosapp.com/instagram-sweepstakes/\">paid services</a> and some other even required you to <a href=\"https://commentpicker.com/instagram.php\">give them your credentials</a>... which doesn't make sense since pictures and comments are public unless the account is private. And I don't think many private accounts do contests adressed to gain more followers.</p>\n<p>That's why I built a small app to solve this problem. It features a conversational UI to get the rules for a given contest and, at the last step, it creates a snippet that gets copied to the user clipboard. Then, this can be pasted in the JavaScript console in the picture page and the winner comment will be highlighted.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/jon-portella-blog/free-instagram-random-comment-picker/\">The app is available here.</a></p>\n<p>In the future I might do a post about the decisions and the findings that features this little project. If I have to take one thing out of this is that conversational UI is super fun to work with!</p>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Picking Random Comments On Instagram","spoiler":"A web app to make Instagram contests suck less.","date":"2019-01-15T15:12:03.284Z"}},"previous":{"slug":"hello-world","frontmatter":{"title":"Hello World","spoiler":"Mandatory","date":"2018-12-31T15:12:03.284Z"}},"next":{"slug":"reddit-image-downloader-node","frontmatter":{"title":"Downloading Reddit Images in Bulk","spoiler":"Get all the neat desktop goodness from /r/wallpapers with this command line utility built in Node.js","date":"2019-01-29T15:12:03.284Z"}}},"__N_SSG":true}
