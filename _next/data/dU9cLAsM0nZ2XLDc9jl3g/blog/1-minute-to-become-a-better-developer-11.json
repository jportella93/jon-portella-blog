Just replacing <code>http</code> for <code>https</code> results in undesired <code>httpss</code> .</p>\n<p>Just replacing <code>http for https produces httpss.</code></p>\n<p>So we only want to match and update <code>http</code> that is not followed by an <code>s</code> . How do we do that?</p>\n<h4>A SOLUTION</h4>\n<p>Enter <strong>Regex’s Negative Lookahead</strong>. The syntax is simple:</p>\n<div class=\"remark-highlight\"><pre class=\"language-unknown\"><code class=\"language-unknown\">http(?!s)</code></pre></div>\n<p>Where:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The parentheses followed by a question mark and exclamation point <code>(?!)</code> is the construct for the Negative Lookahead.</li>\n<li>Characters between the exclamation point and the closing parentheses are the ones negated. In this case, we are only negating the character <code>s</code> .</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here’s a demo on <a href=\"http://regexr.com/5o95i\">RegExr</a>.</p>\n<p>So our solution would be:</p>\n<p>Using Regex’s Negative Lookahead, we can match http and not https.</p>\n<hr>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"1 Minute To Become A Better Developer (#11)","spoiler":"Learn how to use Regex’s Negative Lookahead, in one minute.","date":"2021-03-09T13:51:16.857Z"}},"previous":{"slug":"1-minute-to-become-a-better-developer-10","frontmatter":{"title":"1 Minute To Become A Better Developer (#10)","spoiler":"Learn how to change public your public IP address, in one minute.","date":"2021-03-08T14:03:39.417Z"}},"next":{"slug":"1-minute-to-become-a-better-developer-12","frontmatter":{"title":"1 Minute To Become A Better Developer (#12)","spoiler":"Learn how to leverage window.IntersectionObserver to find out how many visitors see your content, in one minute.","date":"2021-03-10T13:32:36.932Z"}}},"__N_SSG":true}
