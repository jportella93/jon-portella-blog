I used to subscribe to a bunch of blogs and Substacks — mostly engineering-focused newsletters. But I never read them.
They piled up in my inbox when I wasn’t “in the mood.” I thought maybe if I forwarded them to my work email, I’d catch up during slow moments at work. That didn’t work either — too much else going on.

Inbox = never the right place for reading.

Then I came across [Herman’s post on email digital hygiene](https://herman.bearblog.dev/digital-hygiene-emails/). So I tried something else: I installed the iOS app [Inoreader](https://www.inoreader.com) and moved all my subscriptions there. For a few newsletters that don’t support RSS I used [Kill the Newsletter](https://kill-the-newsletter.com) to convert them.

Now — whenever I feel like reading, I open Inoreader. My email stays for actual tasks. And I actually enjoy what I read.

This small change turned information from being pushed to me into something I pull when I’m ready. Learning became enjoyable again.

So basically I added a [RSS feed to this blog](https://jonportella.com/rss.xml).
