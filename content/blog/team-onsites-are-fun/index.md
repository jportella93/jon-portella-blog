One of the things that I struggled the most when I got into my current role at the corporate company coming from a startup its the corporate things in a way like my previous company we were like 20 people and like this one just my team is almost like 15 people so it’s just a different scale and there’s a lot of politics and workflows and processes so I did struggle with that a little bit and also the way you connect with people so before you know it was pre-Covid so we would still go to office more often and you would have like some kind of rapport with these people at least some since we were already semi remote but now in my current team, we are so spread out between Canada and the US that we seldom see each other aside from the camera so it is really special when we have the chance to actually meet in person and these last few days folks came to visit us in Toronto and we had an offsite and it was like so fun apart from being like really really exhausting, but I feel like the social time that you spend especially like dinners and having drinks and those conversations are kind of like the most natural and it’s the way to actually make something like a friendship with people that you don’t see that often and get to know the person behind the screen I think that’s super important and basically it makes the work fun and if it’s not fun then what’s the point of work?
