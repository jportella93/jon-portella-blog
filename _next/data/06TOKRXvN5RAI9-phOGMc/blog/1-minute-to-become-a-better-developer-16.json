Moreover, the more times you set them up, the faster you can get it done the next time.</p>\n<hr>\n<div class=\"remark-highlight\"><pre class=\"language-com\"><code class=\"language-com\">const myArr = [1, 2]\nconsole.log(`Original: ${myArr}`)\n[myArr[0], myArr[1]] = [myArr[1], myArr[0]]\nconsole.log(`Swapped: ${myArr}`)</code></pre></div>\n<div class=\"remark-highlight\"><pre class=\"language-com\"><code class=\"language-com\">const myArr = [1, 2];\nconsole.log(`Original: ${myArr}`)[myArr[0], myArr[1]] = [myArr[1], myArr[0]];\nconsole.log(`Swapped: ${myArr}`);</code></pre></div>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"1 Minute To Become A Better Developer (#16)","spoiler":"Learn to avoid headaches with Static Code Analysis Tools, in one minute.","date":"2021-03-16T13:44:11.170Z"}},"previous":{"slug":"1-minute-to-become-a-better-developer-15","frontmatter":{"title":"1 Minute To Become A Better Developer (#15)","spoiler":"Learn how to remove all your node_modules directories, in one minute.","date":"2021-03-15T13:43:28.380Z"}},"next":{"slug":"1-minute-to-become-a-better-developer-17","frontmatter":{"title":"Forward Proxy vs. Reverse Proxy: OMBD #17","spoiler":"1 Minute To Become A Better Developer (#17)","date":"2021-03-17T13:47:39.957Z"}}},"__N_SSG":true}
