It was my first serious job that I landed after graduating of my Audiovisual Communications degree.</p><p name="fca6" id="fca6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I didn’t quite like it because the working hours were terrible so I couldn’t really have a social life out of work. Moreover, the senior employees in the company didn’t seem very happy with their situation either.</p><p name="d216" id="d216" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">there wasn’t a nice future for me</strong> by doing that.</p><p name="1bc7" id="1bc7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">After a very intense project, I decided to quit the job. I didn’t have a plan B, I just knew I had to stop it cold turkey before finding something else— Impulses are my thing.</p><h3 name="41cc" id="41cc" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">The Search — A Better Future</h3><p name="62f1" id="62f1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">I was in my mid-twenties and the most logical step after my degree in Audiovisual Communications was to do some master’s degree.</p><p name="9451" id="9451" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">After some research, it seemed like <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">every master&#39;s degree cost around 10k</strong>. I thought it was a fair price if that was going to land me with a better-paying job, but <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">the ratios of graduated to employed were pretty low</strong>. Besides, the skills they taught didn’t seem that useful and I wasn’t really interested in them.</p><h3 name="bdc9" id="bdc9" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">First Idea — Masters Degree in Digital Marketing</h3><p name="f479" id="f479" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">In the end, as it seemed I had to pick something and I always was an Internet-friendly person, I picked a Masters&#39;s Degree in Digital Marketing.</p><p name="0cdb" id="0cdb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">However, before actually enrolling, I asked a friend who was working as a digital marketer at the time. In hindsight, that is the best thing I did in a long time.</p><p name="9dd3" id="9dd3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">She told me <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">that was a really bad idea</strong> since she knew me and my profile was none as it was expected for the job. I’d have hated every moment of it.</p><h3 name="cf4f" id="cf4f" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Second Idea — Software Engineering Bootcamp</h3><p name="ffba" id="ffba" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">However, she gave me the idea to enroll in a Software Engineering boot camp. I didn’t really understand that, since <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">I hadn’t any engineering or coding experience.</strong></p><p name="ff53" id="ff53" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">She said that a person from her company did it and now was working as a developer and that I would probably be able to do it too. That was 3 intense months of study but, after that, <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">it was easy to land a good-paying job</strong>.</p><h3 name="e802" id="e802" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Choosing a Bootcamp</h3><p name="4fbb" id="4fbb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">I decided on the boot camp and started comparing. I was looking for something in the Barcelona area. There were many options but in the end, I boiled it down to two: <a href="https://www.ironhack.com/" data-href="https://www.ironhack.com/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Ironhack</a> or <a href="https://codeworks.me/" data-href="https://codeworks.me/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Codeworks</a>.</p><p name="0d7a" id="0d7a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Both of them would <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">take me around 3 months to complete</strong>, but Ironhack was substantially more economic. On the other hand, Codeworks seem to be much more in-depth. Also, despite being a 10k investment, <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">their graduate-to-employee ratio was unbeatable</strong>. So I decided to pick Codeworks and booked an appointment for an intro interview.</p><h3 name="08a8" id="08a8" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">The Selection Process — Part 1. The test</h3><p name="e0f6" id="e0f6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">The process consisted of a one-hour coding test in the boot camp premises and a coding assignment to take home and complete in a week. After setting a date for the test, they pointed me to some free online resources about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to prepare for the test.</p><p name="6473" id="6473" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I learned an immensely high amount of concepts in a short time only by going through those online resources to prepare for the test. <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">I hadn’t learned that much since university.</strong></p><p name="951b" id="951b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">On the day of the test, while I was getting to the office, I was very nervous. The test consisted of resolving a set of simple JavaScript algorithms in a computer next to an instructor. Despite being shaky, I did it correctly and passed the test.</p><h3 name="88a2" id="88a2" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">The Selection Process — Part 2. The assignment</h3><p name="8bba" id="8bba" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Now it was time for the take-home assignment. The instructor let me chose between 3 projects and I — completely dedicated to this new path — took the most difficult one: building a BlackJack game.</p><p name="d61e" id="d61e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I was working on the assignment for the whole week. I became an expert in searching Google and Stack Overflow for problems that appeared in my code and, in the end, <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">I achieved </strong><a href="https://jportella93.github.io/Blackjack/index.html" data-href="https://jportella93.github.io/Blackjack/index.html" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">a very decent BlackJack game</strong></a><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"> that impressed the reviewers</strong>.</p><h3 name="723a" id="723a" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">The Pre-Course</h3><p name="579c" id="579c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">After this, I paid a part of the tuition and received my pre-course resources, which consisted of 3 very complex exercises which I had to finish in order to get admitted to the boot camp.</p><p name="1c1d" id="1c1d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">These were<strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"> really difficult</strong>. It touched very complex JavaScript concepts which many professional developers don’t really know. However, after 2 intense weeks, I finished them and was ready to start the course!</p><h3 name="657f" id="657f" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">The Course</h3><p name="bcd1" id="bcd1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">I started in the April batch. In my batch, there were 13 more people from around the world who also were aspiring Software Developers.</p><p name="cb92" id="cb92" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Those were 3 intense months</strong>. We were on campus from Monday to Saturday, from 8.30 am to 9 pm. And sometimes we’d also go on Sunday to recover topics.</p><p name="1363" id="1363" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It was hands-down<strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"> the most intense learning experience I had</strong>. We went in-depth over every topic related to working as a Software Developer. When we were about to master a concept, we were already starting with the next one. There was virtually no time to get bored, it was frenetic. The instructors<strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"> were very good</strong> and helped us when we got stuck.</p><p name="feb0" id="feb0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">After the first half of the course learning and solidifying all the topics. There was the second half, where we build 3 web applications from the ground up. <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">These proved invaluable for the job search</strong>. Finally, in the last part of the course, we spend some time focusing in how to get a good developer job and how to ace interviews.</p><h3 name="5f22" id="5f22" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">My Post-Bootcamp Job</h3><p name="2304" id="2304" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">As soon as I finished the boot camp, my job became finding a job. I spent several hours a day going through LinkedIn and other job boards, contacting recruiters, and doing tests. I made a spreadsheet with all the companies I had applied to, the contact person, and the state of the selection process.</p><p name="5561" id="5561" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Three weeks after graduating</strong>, after several interviews, I found a company that seemed really interesting, <a href="https://n1-headache.com/" data-href="https://n1-headache.com/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Curelator N1-Headache</a>. Their mission is to help people suffering from migraine to control them by using an individualized analytical approach. I had a couple of meetings with the company and decided it was a good place to start my career as Software Developer, <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">I got hired</strong>.</p><p name="6864" id="6864" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The best part was that<strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"> I recovered my boot camp investment in 3 months.</strong></p><h3 name="d856" id="d856" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Two Years Later</h3><p name="699c" id="699c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">I’m still in the same company, currently as a Front-End Engineer. <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">I have an important role over most products in the company</strong>. Besides, I’ve learned a number of skills and keep doing so every day.</p><p name="a9b9" id="a9b9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Also, one day a week, I’m<strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"> forming new Software developers</strong> in the boot camp where I learned everything on this subject.
