Here’s How To Stick to It</h3>\n<h4>Many people struggle to build a writing habit. I did too, but I solved it with this simple mantra</h4>\n<p><img src=\"/content/blog/trying-to-write-every-day-heres-how-to-stick-to-it/images/0.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>In my experience, that’s easy to implement if you follow some simple steps. Keep on reading to know how to exactly how.</p>\n<h4>Tip #1: write short-form stories.</h4>\n<p>In the beginning, I was writing long-form articles, which took me between 2 to 3 hours to write.</p>\n<p>It was difficult to find such a big empty spot in my schedule, and almost impossible for me to do it regularly.</p>\n<p>Moreover, if I did write, I didn’t want to spend so much time again on the same task the next day.</p>\n<p>So how can you keep motivated to write often?</p>\n<p>Getting down my writing effort from 2–3 hours to 30 minutes is key for keeping my energies to create more content the following day.</p>\n<hr>\n<h4>Tip #2: Timebox your writing.</h4>\n<p>Although I only wanted to spend 30 minutes writing, usually the attention to detail made me spend a long time finishing the article.</p>\n<p>But everything changed when I tried to time-box the writing process.</p>\n<p>I find that timeboxing allows you to pace yourself and distribute your limited time.</p>\n<p>It also forces you to have a finished product when time is up.</p>\n<hr>\n<h4>Tip #3: Include writing in your routine.</h4>\n<p>Now I needed to fit that those 30 minutes somewhere in my day.</p>\n<p>First I tried in the evening, but that’s my free time and depending on the plans I have on that day, I couldn’t separate time for writing.</p>\n<p>After some trial and error, I found that the best time to implement a routine was the morning because:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I always wake up at the same time.</li>\n<li>I always start working at the same time.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So I came up with the following procedure:</p>\n<p>Also, this plays well with timeboxing, since if I keep writing for more than 30 minutes, I’ll arrive late at work!</p>\n<p>This has proved to be super effective, and I haven’t missed a day of writing.</p>\n<hr>\n<h4>Tip #4: Track your ideas.</h4>\n<p>Finally, writing every day requires some preparation.</p>\n<p>Keep this list handy since ideas may come to your mind at any given point during the day, and you want to write them down before they’re forgotten!</p>\n<hr>\n<h4>Putting it all together</h4>\n<p>So here’s my trick for being able to write every day:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Compile a list of topics you want to write about. You should be able to update this list at any moment an idea comes to mind.</li>\n<li>Before going to bed, check that list and select a topic to write about tomorrow.</li>\n<li>Wake up 30 minutes earlier, check again the topic and start thinking about the article while you go through your morning routine.</li>\n<li>Spend those extra 30 minutes writing, not a minute more. It’s easier if you start working right after those 30 minutes.</li>\n<li>Hit publish. Share your article.</li>\n<li>Continue with your day, write any idea for a future article in the topics list.</li>\n<li>Repeat from step #2.</li>\n</ol>\n<hr>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Trying To Write Every Day?
