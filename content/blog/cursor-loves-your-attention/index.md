It’s interesting to think how much has the craft of a software builder changed in the last year? I remember well while I was in parental leave I watched a video by Siraj Raval, who was basically vibe coding in cursor YOLO mode a stock market web app, and at that point, I knew everything was going to be changing Super fast like I also a few months before that I listened to the podcast of Lex Friedman, who was interviewing the cursor guys and I was a bit sceptic like what’s the point of doing a whole integration of LLM in an IDE when there was stuff like VSCode copilot already working but boy was I wrong the flow of just letting the coding agent go do its thing while you do l another thing and then come back to it and iterate on that that’s just priceless and it’s even become a bit of problem for me because even though building software is my main output on my 9 to 5 job it’s at the same time one of my hobbies so I have several side projects and ideas that I like going on at the same time and being able to send coding agents to those while I’m at home doing something else and then coming back to it is amazing but also a source of shifted focus and many distractions
