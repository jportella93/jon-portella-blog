            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s interesting to think how much has the craft of a software builder changed in the last year? I remember well while I was in parental leave I watched a video by Siraj Raval, who was basically vibe coding in cursor YOLO mode a stock market web app, and at that point, I knew everything was going to be changing Super fast like I also a few months before that I listened to the podcast of Lex Friedman, who was interviewing the cursor guys and I was a bit sceptic like what’s the point of doing a whole integration of LLM in an IDE when there was stuff like VSCode copilot already working but boy was I wrong the flow of just letting the coding agent go do its thing while you do l another thing and then come back to it and iterate on that that’s just priceless and it’s even become a bit of problem for me because even though building software is my main output on my 9 to 5 job it’s at the same time one of my hobbies so I have several side projects and ideas that I like going on at the same time and being able to send coding agents to those while I’m at home doing something else and then coming back to it is amazing but also a source of shifted focus and many distractions</p>

            <description><![CDATA[Generally on favour of them]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the things that I struggled the most when I got into my current role at the corporate company coming from a startup its the corporate things in a way like my previous company we were like 20 people and like this one just my team is almost like 15 people so it’s just a different scale and there’s a lot of politics and workflows and processes so I did struggle with that a little bit and also the way you connect with people so before you know it was pre-Covid so we would still go to office more often and you would have like some kind of rapport with these people at least some since we were already semi remote but now in my current team, we are so spread out between Canada and the US that we seldom see each other aside from the camera so it is really special when we have the chance to actually meet in person and these last few days folks came to visit us in Toronto and we had an offsite and it was like so fun apart from being like really really exhausting, but I feel like the social time that you spend especially like dinners and having drinks and those conversations are kind of like the most natural and it’s the way to actually make something like a friendship with people that you don’t see that often and get to know the person behind the screen I think that’s super important and basically it makes the work fun and if it’s not fun then what’s the point of work?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hey long time no write it’s been a while I’ve just been quite busy I guess since I joined Pinterest I haven’t really written anymore and that was like four years ago so so yeah the previous post it was an experiment just trying to one shot at an article on ChatGPT, as you can really tell by how it’s written it’s quite interesting how we moved away from the artisanal writing thing into more like LLM powered content machine, where basically everything that we write ends up being filtered out by the LLM and then probably scraped by another LLM and served in a different shape so I guess that’s what has made me want to come back and share my thoughts in a really natural way like I’m literally dictating this into a note and I’m just gonna push it so yeah stay tuned for more random updates maybe like I’ll talk about more software stuff who knows things change a lot</p>

            <description><![CDATA[Learn how to prevent your custom aliases to be lost in oblivion, in one minute.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>Autosave Your Shell Config in a GitHub Gist</h1>
<h2>Don’t lose your aliases again when switching computers!</h2>
<h3>THE PROBLEM</h3>
<p>You get a new computer, you back up all your files but…</p>
<p>OH! you forgot to back up your <code>~/.bashrc</code> or <code>~/.zshrc</code> where all your custom aliases and functions live! Now you need to start over with them…</p>
<h3>A SOLUTION</h3>
<p>To save you this headache, I’m sharing my super-useful custom alias for updating my shell config that does the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Opens your shell config file.</li>
<li>Saves a copy of the updated file on a secret <a href="https://gist.github.com/">Github Gist</a>.</li>
<li>Refreshes your shell session so you can use the updated command right away.</li>
</ol>
<p>Let’s set it up.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This tutorial assumes you’re using <a href="https://www.zsh.org/">zsh</a>. If your are using <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/">bash</a>, just replace <code>zsh</code> and <code>.zshrc</code> by <code>bash</code> and <code>.bashrc</code> in the next commands. You can find out which shell you’re using by running <code>echo $0</code> .</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Let’s create a secret <a href="https://gist.github.com/">gist</a> where our config will be saved:</li>
</ol>
<p>Creating a secret <a href="https://gist.github.com/">Gist</a>.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>Copy the Gist identifier from the URL, the last part. In my case the URL is <code>https://gist.github.com/jportella93/616c872593daf91781d6842c9829b1f0</code> so I’m copying <code>616c872593daf91781d6842c9829b1f0</code> .</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In your <code>~/.zshrc</code> include this line:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<div class="remark-highlight"><pre class="language-shell"><code class="language-shell"><span class="token builtin class-name">alias</span> <span class="token assign-left variable">zshrc</span><span class="token operator">=</span><span class="token string">"gedit ~/.zshrc &#x26;&#x26; gist-paste -u 616c872593daf91781d6842c9829b1f0 ~/.zshrc &#x26;&#x26; exec zsh"</span>
</code></pre></div>
<blockquote>
<p>I’m using <code>gedit</code> as text editor but you can use any other like <code>nano</code>, <code>vim</code> or <code>code</code> . Then replace the gist identifier <code>616c872593daf91781d6842c9829b1f0</code> with the one you copied in the previous step.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="4">
<li>
<p>If you haven’t already, install <a href="https://github.com/defunkt/gist">gist</a> to be able to interact with Github Gist from the CLI, in this article I explain how to do it quickly:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now you’re all set! When you want to update an alias in your <code>~/.zshrc</code> just type <code>zshrc</code> in your CLI, make changes on your text editor, and changes will be backed up on the Gist automatically. Moreover, you’ll be able to use your updated alias right away! How cool is that?</p>
</li>
</ol>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Using SVGs on the Web — A Deep Dive</h3>
<h4>There isn’t one best way to implement SVGs on our websites, since each method has its pros and cons. Learning their differences is a crucial skill for a good Web Developer.</h4>
<p><img src="/content/blog/using-svgs-on-the-web-a-deep-dive/images/0.png" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG)</strong> allow you to present pictures that are lightweight and can scale without being pixelated.</p>
<p>However, we can implement them in several ways in our websites, and some methods allow for some features that others don’t.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Implementation-dependent SVG Features</h3>
<p>Here’s a list of features that you can have or not depending on how you serve your SVGs.</p>
<h4>Alt and title attribute availability</h4>
<p><code>alt</code> attribute sets a text description rendered when the image is not available, whereas a <code>title</code> attribute is usually shown in a tooltip when hovering the image. These are used for accessibility and SEO.</p>
<h4>Browser caching</h4>
<p>Results in faster load times and, hence, better UX and SEO rankings.</p>
<h4>Interactivity</h4>
<p>SVGs can be manipulated and animated with CSS and JavaScript. They can also include hyperlinks wrapping their shapes.</p>
<h4>Search engine indexing</h4>
<p>Important point since <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2010/08/google-now-indexes-svg">Google announced that they’ll start crawling and indexing SVGs</a>.</p>
<h4>Encapsulation</h4>
<p>SVGs can contain classes and IDs, which should not clash with these attributes on other SVGs on the page.</p>
<hr>
<h3>SVG implementation methods</h3>
<p>Now that we know which features we may have or not depending on how we embed our SVGs, let’s compare these embedding methods.</p>
<p>They can be divided into two groups by methodology:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Methods related to pointing the browser to the URL of the SVG file</strong>. These generally can benefit from browser caching but have limited options for interactivity.</li>
<li><strong>Methods related to hardcoding the SVG inside a static asset such as HTML, CSS, or JS file</strong>. These can't be cached separately as they are embedded in the file, but for this reason, we save HTTP requests, which is interesting since browsers not using HTTP2 can only do a limited number of concurrent requests. Also, they are best for reacting to user interaction.</li>
</ol>
<h3>1. SVG implementation methods related to pointing the browser to the URL of the SVG file.</h3>
<h3>1.1 As an  src</h3>
<h4>Features</h4>
<ul>
<li>✅ Alt/title attribute</li>
<li>✅ Browser caching</li>
<li>❌ Interactivity</li>
<li>✅ Search engine indexing</li>
<li>✅ Encapsulation</li>
</ul>
<h4>Also, note</h4>
<ul>
<li>If width/height is not specified as an attribute or CSS rule, the original SVG file size is used.</li>
<li>They are encapsulated, so their IDs and classes don’t clash with other SVGs.</li>
</ul>
<h4>When to use</h4>
<ul>
<li>When interactivity is not an issue, for example, if your SVG is not animated on user input.</li>
</ul>
<div class="remark-highlight"><pre class="language-html"><code class="language-html"><span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&#x3C;</span>img</span> <span class="token attr-name">src</span><span class="token attr-value"><span class="token punctuation attr-equals">=</span><span class="token punctuation">"</span>user.svg<span class="token punctuation">"</span></span> <span class="token attr-name">alt</span><span class="token attr-value"><span class="token punctuation attr-equals">=</span><span class="token punctuation">"</span>User<span class="token punctuation">"</span></span> <span class="token punctuation">/></span></span>
</code></pre></div>
<h3>1.2. As a CSS background-image</h3>
<h4>Features</h4>
<ul>
<li>✅ Alt/title attribute</li>
<li>✅ Browser caching</li>
<li>❌ Interactivity</li>
<li>✅ Search engine indexing</li>
<li>✅ Encapsulation</li>
</ul>
<h4>Also, note</h4>
<ul>
<li>Same as method 1.1 but this time we can use any HTML tag instead of an <code>img</code> .</li>
</ul>
<h4>When to use</h4>
<ul>
<li>When interactivity is not an issue.</li>
<li>When you can't use an <code>img</code> tag.</li>
<li>When you prefer to keep the SVG URL in your CSS file rather than in your HTML file.</li>
</ul>
<div class="remark-highlight"><pre class="language-css"><code class="language-css"><span class="token selector"><span class="token class">.user-svg</span></span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>
  <span class="token property">background-image</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token url"><span class="token function">url</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>user.svg<span class="token punctuation">)</span></span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
<span class="token punctuation">}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<h3>1.3 As an  data</h3>
<h4>Features</h4>
<ul>
<li>❌ Alt/title attribute</li>
<li>✅ Browser caching</li>
<li>🟡 Interactivity</li>
<li>❌ Search engine indexing</li>
<li>✅ Encapsulation</li>
</ul>
<h4>Also, note</h4>
<ul>
<li>It’s somewhat interactive since it allows setting hyperlinks on parts of the SVG. However, it can’t be modified with JS or CSS.</li>
<li>Y<a href="https://wet-boew.github.io/wet-boew-documentation/decision/1.html">ou can have problems with setting a tabindex attribute</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h4>When to use</h4>
<ul>
<li>When you need hyperlinks in parts of the SVG.</li>
</ul>
<div class="remark-highlight"><pre class="language-html"><code class="language-html"><span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&#x3C;</span>object</span> <span class="token attr-name">data</span><span class="token attr-value"><span class="token punctuation attr-equals">=</span><span class="token punctuation">"</span>user.svg<span class="token punctuation">"</span></span> <span class="token attr-name">width</span><span class="token attr-value"><span class="token punctuation attr-equals">=</span><span class="token punctuation">"</span>300<span class="token punctuation">"</span></span> <span class="token attr-name">height</span><span class="token attr-value"><span class="token punctuation attr-equals">=</span><span class="token punctuation">"</span>300<span class="token punctuation">"</span></span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span><span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&#x3C;/</span>object</span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span>
</code></pre></div>
<h3>1.4 &#x26; 1.5 As an or an  src</h3>
<p>These last two methods were used in the past but nowadays their usage has decreased. They are generally not recommended for use.</p>
<p>SVGs used as <code>iframe</code> src have raised concerns about hurting SEO. Moreover, using this method we lose the scalability property of the SVG.</p>
<p>And SVGs used as <code>embed</code> src were primarily focused on browser plugins like Flash, which most browsers have stopped supporting.</p>
<div class="remark-highlight"><pre class="language-html"><code class="language-html"><span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&#x3C;</span>iframe</span> <span class="token attr-name">src</span><span class="token attr-value"><span class="token punctuation attr-equals">=</span><span class="token punctuation">"</span>user.svg<span class="token punctuation">"</span></span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span><span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&#x3C;/</span>iframe</span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span>
</code></pre></div>
<div class="remark-highlight"><pre class="language-html"><code class="language-html"><span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&#x3C;</span>embed</span> <span class="token attr-name">src</span><span class="token attr-value"><span class="token punctuation attr-equals">=</span><span class="token punctuation">"</span>user.svg<span class="token punctuation">"</span></span> <span class="token punctuation">/></span></span>
</code></pre></div>
<h3>2. SVG implementation methods related to hardcoding the SVG code inside a static asset such as HTML, CSS, or JS file.</h3>
<h3>2.1 Inline SVG in HTML</h3>
<p>Basically writing the whole SVG code into the HTML document. This is what some popular SVG libraries like d3 do.</p>
<h4>Features</h4>
<ul>
<li>❌ Alt/title attribute</li>
<li>❌ Browser caching</li>
<li>✅ Interactivity</li>
<li>❌ Search engine indexing</li>
<li>❌ Encapsulation</li>
</ul>
<h4>Also, note</h4>
<ul>
<li>SVGs implemented this way can be fully manipulated with CSS and JS since their internal tags are treated as DOM nodes.</li>
<li>Since the SVG code is embedded in the HTML, we save an HTTP request for the asset, although now the HTML file is heavier.</li>
</ul>
<h4>When to use</h4>
<p>When you need to animate properties on any tag inside the SVG such as color/fill, opacity, and movement.</p>
<div class="remark-highlight"><pre class="language-html"><code class="language-html"><span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&#x3C;</span>body</span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span>

<p>Similar to 1.1 and 1.2 but in this case instead of pointing the src property of the image or the CSS URL to an external asset, you just put the SVG code there as value.</p>

<h4>Features</h4>
<ul>
<li>✅ Alt/title attribute</li>
<li>✅ Browser caching</li>
<li>❌ Interactivity</li>
<li>✅Search engine indexing</li>
<li>✅ Encapsulation</li>
</ul>
<h4>Also, note</h4>
<ul>
<li>The SVG can be encoded in any shape that the browser understands. In the example, it’s <a href="https://yoksel.github.io/url-encoder/">URL encoded</a>, but it can also be base 64 encoded, for example.</li>
<li>Since the SVG code is embedded in the HTML/CSS, we save an HTTP request for the asset, although now the HTML/CSS file is heavier.</li>
</ul>
<h4>When to use</h4>
<p>When the SVG doesn’t need interactivity and is light enough that we rather embed it in our HTML file than do an HTTP request for it.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>There isn’t a one-size-fits-all approach when it comes to implementing SVGs on the web, it depends on which features you are looking for.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading and never stop learning! 😄</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>Running Code Snippets on Chrome's Console</h1>
<h2>A quick guide for web developers on this great time-saver when executing JavaScript on the go.</h2>
<h3>THE PROBLEM</h3>
<p>You want to test a registration form on a website. Instead of filling it up manually every time, you may come up with a snippet like this that does it automatically for you:</p>
<p>Now, instead of copy-pasting it over and over, it would be great if we could store it on the browser so when we want to use it we can retrieve it and run it easily.</p>
<h3>A SOLUTION</h3>
<p>Fortunately, Chrome’s DevTools provide functionality for this: <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/javascript/snippets">snippets</a>.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Open <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/open">Chrome’s DevTools</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Press ctrl/cmd + shift + p to show <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/command-menu">Chrome’s </a><a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/open">DevTools</a><a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/command-menu"> command menu</a>:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Type “show snippets” and select that option</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This will reveal the Snippets tab under the sources panel.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Tap on <code>+ New snippet</code></p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Name your snippet and input its content on the right-hand panel.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now that your snippet is saved, you can press <strong>ctrl/cmd + enter to run iton the page</strong>!</p>
<p>Snippets will persist between browser sessions, so you can retrieve and run them easily.</p>
<p><strong>BONUS</strong>: here’s <a href="https://bgrins.github.io/devtools-snippets/">a list of snippets</a> to get you inspired.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>CDNs — A Deep Dive</h3>
<h4>You’ve used them before but you’re not completely sure what they are, here are some answers.</h4>
<p><img src="/content/blog/cdns-a-deep-dive/images/0.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Single server versus Content Delivery Network (CDN) by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:NCDN_-_CDN.png">Kanoha</a> on Wikimedia Commons</p>
<h3>What is a CDN?</h3>
<p>A **Content Distribution **(or Delivery) **Network **(<strong>CDN</strong>) is a group of servers distributed geographically with the purpose of providing fast delivery of Internet content.</p>
<p>The CDN's servers act as reverse proxies for your origin servers, where the content is hosted.</p>
<p>Servers are contained in facilities called <strong>Points of Presence</strong> (<strong>PoP</strong>), which are spread around the globe.</p>
<h3>How does a CDN work?</h3>
<p>Servers in a CDN can help provide a better user experience by caching content closer to the user and delivering it instead of the origin server.</p>
<p>This reduces the <strong>Round Trip Time (RTT)</strong> which is the number of milliseconds (ms) it takes for a browser to send a request and receive a response back from a server.</p>
<p><img src="/content/blog/cdns-a-deep-dive/images/1.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Without CDN vs with CDN by <a href="https://www.imperva.com/learn/performance/what-is-cdn-how-it-works/">Imperva</a></p>
<h4><strong>Without CDN</strong></h4>
<ol>
<li>A user in Barcelona, Spain opens her browser and navigates to <a href="http://example.com/">http://example.com/</a>. The browser does an HTTP request <code>GET http://example.com/index.html</code></li>
<li>The website is hosted on a server based in Boston, United States, so the request has to travel across the Atlantic ocean and be processed by the origin server. Then, the server’s response has to travel back to Barcelona.</li>
<li>This causes a <strong>high RTT</strong> and a <strong>suboptimal UX</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<h4><strong>With CDN</strong></h4>
<ol>
<li>A user in Barcelona, Spain opens her browser and navigates to <a href="http://example.com/">http://example.com/</a>. The browser does an HTTP request <code>GET http://example.com/index.html</code></li>
<li>When a user requests an asset, the DNS routes the request to the best performing PoP location, which usually is the geographically closest one to the client.</li>
</ol>
<p>At this point, there are 2 possible outcomes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The asset is available:</strong> A non-stale copy of the requested asset is present in the PoP’s cache servers, so the asset is sent back to the user directly, resulting in a <strong>shorter RTT</strong>, hence a better UX.</li>
<li><strong>The asset is NOT available</strong>: The PoP’s server re-routes the request to the origin server, which sends back a fresh version of the asset. The PoP’s server caches the asset and sends it back to the user. This time the RTT is longer but subsequent requests for this asset in this region will be faster since the asset is now available in the PoP’s cache servers.</li>
</ul>
<p>The asset remains cached on the PoP’s cache server until the <strong>time-to-live (TTL)</strong> specified by its HTTP headers expires.</p>
<h3>Pros/cons of using a CDN?</h3>
<p>The most obvious benefit is the **better UX **caused by the **faster RTT **that comes with using cached content in proximity to the user.</p>
<p>Beyond that, using a CDN can result in <strong>increased uptime</strong> on a website. Imagine a traffic overload or a hardware failure that incapacitates your origin server. Having cached content on the distributed CDN’s servers can prevent interruptions on the service for end-users. Moreover, since the content is redundant in the CDN’s servers, a failure in one PoP can be saved by the content on another PoP.</p>
<p>Another benefit is that by serving cached content, <strong>bandwidth costs on the origin server are reduced</strong>. However, the CDN provider might charge a substantial fee, making this benefit tiny, so take this point <em>with a grain of salt</em>!</p>
<p>Also, it is worth noting that some CDN providers, by leveraging the reverse proxy configuration, are crossing to other services. Some use the CDNs distributed configuration to provide <strong>protection againstDistributed Denial of Service(DDOS) attacks</strong>. Also, they may implement load balancers to avoid overloading origin servers with huge amounts of traffic.</p>
<h3>Which types of CDNs exist?</h3>
<p>At the time of writing, there are 6 major types of CDN:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Free</strong> CDNs, whose task is to serve open source packages. E.g. jsDelivr.</li>
<li><strong>Commercial</strong> CDNs, provide their services to the public at a cost. E.g. Cloudflare.</li>
<li>**In-House **CDNs, launched by companies whose business model makes commercial CDN options not worth their costs, so they roll out their own private CDN. E.g. Netflix.</li>
<li>**Telco **CDNs, launched by Telecommunications Service Providers (TSPs) in order to serve their own streaming content without leasing commercial CDNs. They’re similar to In-Hose CDNs. E.g. Verizon.</li>
<li><strong>Peer to Peer</strong> (P2P) CDNs, used to share assets between individuals who are equally privileged in the application, or peers. E.g. BitTorrent.</li>
<li><strong>Multi</strong> CDNs, leverage the power of several other CDNs. E.g. MetaCDN.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Why don’t CDNs come by default in web hosting?</h3>
<p>When CDNs were starting to appear in the late 90s, they were really expensive so not all organizations could afford them.</p>
<p>Nowadays, the reductions in cost have made CDNs a more accessible option, and many hosting providers actually offer CDN services as a checkbox add-on.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>We’ll learn how to implement a browser auto-saving draft system in JavaScript</h4>
<p><img src="/content/blog/ombd-14-how-to-call-a-function-when-a-user-stops-typing/images/0.png" alt=""></p>
<h4>THE PROBLEM</h4>
<p>We are implementing a text editor with a Google-Docs-like draft system, where content gets saved server-side when the user stops typing for a second.</p>
<h4>A SOLUTION</h4>
<p>We are going to use the <code>keyup</code> event and <code>window.setTimeout</code> .</p>
<p>The key to this snippet is that the <code>timerId</code> has to be set declared in the scope of the <code>keyup</code> callback, in order to be reassigned to the new timeout id every time the <code>keyup</code> callback is fired again.</p>
<p>Here’s a demo on CodePen:</p>
<p>Call function when the user stops typing.</p>
<div class="remark-highlight"><pre class="language-javascript"><code class="language-javascript"><span class="token comment">// Declare a new variable that will get reassigned later with the timeout id</span>
<span class="token keyword">let</span> timerId

<span class="token comment">// Get the DOM Node of the input area and listen for a keyup event</span>
<span class="token dom variable">document</span><span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token method function property-access">querySelector</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">'textarea'</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token method function property-access">addEventListener</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">'keyup'</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token arrow operator">=></span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>
  <span class="token comment">// Clear timeout to callback, doesn't do anything on first run since timerId is undefined</span>
  <span class="token function">clearTimeout</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>timerId<span class="token punctuation">)</span>
  <span class="token comment">// Set timerId to fire callback in one second, unless another keyup event is triggered</span>
  timerId <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token dom variable">window</span><span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token method function property-access">setTimeout</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>renderCurrentTime<span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token number">1000</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span>
<span class="token punctuation">}</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span>

<span class="token comment">// Callback that will get fired 1s after typing</span>
<span class="token keyword">function</span> <span class="token function">renderCurrentTime</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>
  <span class="token comment">// TODO: Save note to server</span>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Trying To Write Every Day? Here’s How To Stick to It</h3>
<h4>Many people struggle to build a writing habit. I did too, but I solved it with this simple mantra</h4>
<p><img src="/content/blog/trying-to-write-every-day-heres-how-to-stick-to-it/images/0.png" alt=""></p>
<p>In my experience, that’s easy to implement if you follow some simple steps. Keep on reading to know how to exactly how.</p>
<h4>Tip #1: write short-form stories.</h4>
<p>In the beginning, I was writing long-form articles, which took me between 2 to 3 hours to write.</p>
<p>It was difficult to find such a big empty spot in my schedule, and almost impossible for me to do it regularly.</p>
<p>Moreover, if I did write, I didn’t want to spend so much time again on the same task the next day.</p>
<p>So how can you keep motivated to write often?</p>
<p>Getting down my writing effort from 2–3 hours to 30 minutes is key for keeping my energies to create more content the following day.</p>
<hr>
<h4>Tip #2: Timebox your writing.</h4>
<p>Although I only wanted to spend 30 minutes writing, usually the attention to detail made me spend a long time finishing the article.</p>
<p>But everything changed when I tried to time-box the writing process.</p>
<p>I find that timeboxing allows you to pace yourself and distribute your limited time.</p>
<p>It also forces you to have a finished product when time is up.</p>
<hr>
<h4>Tip #3: Include writing in your routine.</h4>
<p>Now I needed to fit that those 30 minutes somewhere in my day.</p>
<p>First I tried in the evening, but that’s my free time and depending on the plans I have on that day, I couldn’t separate time for writing.</p>
<p>After some trial and error, I found that the best time to implement a routine was the morning because:</p>
<ul>
<li>I always wake up at the same time.</li>
<li>I always start working at the same time.</li>
</ul>
<p>So I came up with the following procedure:</p>
<p>Also, this plays well with timeboxing, since if I keep writing for more than 30 minutes, I’ll arrive late at work!</p>
<p>This has proved to be super effective, and I haven’t missed a day of writing.</p>
<hr>
<h4>Tip #4: Track your ideas.</h4>
<p>Finally, writing every day requires some preparation.</p>
<p>Keep this list handy since ideas may come to your mind at any given point during the day, and you want to write them down before they’re forgotten!</p>
<hr>
<h4>Putting it all together</h4>
<p>So here’s my trick for being able to write every day:</p>
<ol>
<li>Compile a list of topics you want to write about. You should be able to update this list at any moment an idea comes to mind.</li>
<li>Before going to bed, check that list and select a topic to write about tomorrow.</li>
<li>Wake up 30 minutes earlier, check again the topic and start thinking about the article while you go through your morning routine.</li>
<li>Spend those extra 30 minutes writing, not a minute more. It’s easier if you start working right after those 30 minutes.</li>
<li>Hit publish. Share your article.</li>
<li>Continue with your day, write any idea for a future article in the topics list.</li>
<li>Repeat from step #2.</li>
</ol>

<h2>A quick tip to save time on saving and sharing documents</h2>
<h3>THE PROBLEM</h3>
<p>You are saving <a href="https://gist.github.com/">Github Gists</a> often but you spend too much time on their UI.</p>
<h3>A SOLUTION</h3>
<p>Let’s do it from our CLI!</p>
<ol>
<li>Install <a href="https://github.com/defunkt/gist">Gist</a> following the <a href="https://github.com/defunkt/gist#installation">instructions for your system</a>. In my case is Ubuntu so:</li>
</ol>
<div class="remark-highlight"><pre class="language-shell"><code class="language-shell"><span class="token function">sudo</span> <span class="token function">apt</span> <span class="token function">install</span> gist
</code></pre></div>
<ol start="2">
<li>Go to the <a href="https://github.com/settings/tokens">tokens section in GitHub</a> and press on “Generate new token”. Input your password in the next screen:</li>
</ol>
<p>T<a href="https://github.com/settings/tokens">okens section in GitHub</a>.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Set a name for your token and make sure to check the <code>gist</code> and <code>user:email</code> permissions:</li>
</ol>
<p>Set a name for your token like <code>gist.</code></p>
<p>Check <strong>gist</strong> and <strong>user:email</strong> permissions.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Copy your generated token:</li>
</ol>
<p>Generated token.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Save the token in <code>~/.gist</code>. The <code>umask</code> ensures that the file is only accessible from your user account:</li>
</ol>
<div class="remark-highlight"><pre class="language-shell"><code class="language-shell"><span class="token punctuation">(</span>umask 0077 <span class="token operator">&#x26;&#x26;</span> <span class="token builtin class-name">echo</span> MY_SECRET_TOKEN <span class="token operator">></span> ~/.gist<span class="token punctuation">)</span>
</code></pre></div>
<ol start="6">
<li>Check that it has been saved correctly:</li>
</ol>
<div class="remark-highlight"><pre class="language-shell"><code class="language-shell"><span class="token function">cat</span> ~/.gist
</code></pre></div>
<ol start="7">
<li>Now we can create gists from the command line!</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Note that in Ubuntu/Debian the <code>gist</code> command is renamed to <code>gist-paste</code> to avoid conflicts, if you are using a different system like MacOS just replace<code> gist-paste</code> for <code>gist</code> in the next snippet.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="remark-highlight"><pre class="language-shell"><code class="language-shell"><span class="token builtin class-name">echo</span> <span class="token string">"hello gist"</span> <span class="token operator">>></span> gist.txtgist-paste gist.txt<span class="token comment"># Returns URL of newly created gist https://gist.github.com/eb36806673aca3c63686078d584e2a2e</span>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>Let’s learn to use the power of this advanced tool for Git disaster‑saving</h4>
<p><img src="/content/blog/time-traveling-in-git-meet-git-reflog/images/0.png" alt=""></p>
<h4>THE PROBLEM</h4>
<p>A local branch deleted by accident, squashed commits that we would like to be un-squashed… when a catastrophe occurs, wouldn’t it be great if we could <strong>time-travel in Git</strong>?</p>
<h4>A SOLUTION</h4>
<p>Let’s learn how to use <code>git reflog</code>. First, abit of context.</p>
<p>Reference logs, or “reflogs”, record when the tips of branches and other references were updated in the local repository.</p>
<p><code>git reflog</code> by default targets HEAD — a symbolic reference to the currently active branch — but other branches, tags, remotes, and the Git stash can also be targeted.</p>
<p><code>git reflog</code> shows “movements” with the syntax <code>name@{qualifier}</code>. E.g. <code>HEAD@{2}</code> means “where HEAD used to be two moves ago”.</p>
<p>Let’s put it into practice.</p>
<h4>Recovering a locally deleted branch</h4>
<p>We’ve deleted a local branch, how can we recover it?</p>
<div class="remark-highlight"><pre class="language-shell"><code class="language-shell"><span class="token function">git</span> branch <span class="token parameter variable">-D</span> navbar-feature
</code></pre></div>
<p>We can use <code>git reflog</code> to find a point in history to time‑travel to. We see that one move ago we did the last commit on that branch that we just deleted.</p>
<div class="remark-highlight"><pre class="language-text"><code class="language-text">3b7a6fdb (HEAD -&#x26;gt; master) HEAD@{0}: checkout: moving from navbar-feature to master9a07e99f HEAD@{1}: commit: feat: add Navbar3b7a6fdb (HEAD -&#x26;gt; master) HEAD@{2}: checkout: moving from master to navbar-feature</code></pre></div>
<p>So we can just create a new branch with the content of that point in history:</p>
<div class="remark-highlight"><pre class="language-shell"><code class="language-shell"><span class="token function">git</span> checkout <span class="token parameter variable">-b</span> navbar-feature HEAD@<span class="token punctuation">{</span><span class="token number">1</span><span class="token punctuation">}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Fantastic, we have recovered our branch and its commits!</p>
<h4>Recovering squashed commits</h4>
<p>We have 3 commits:</p>
<div class="remark-highlight"><pre class="language-text"><code class="language-text">747ef1e feat: add Button19d9327 feat: add Navbareffb3b4 initial commit</code></pre></div>
<p>We realize that we forget to add something on the Navbar commit, so we add those changes and we commit with a fixup <code>git commit --fixup 19d9327</code>. Our history now:</p>
<div class="remark-highlight"><pre class="language-text"><code class="language-text">c2149d1 fixup! feat: add Navbar747ef1e feat: add Button19d9327 feat: add Navbareffb3b4 initial commit</code></pre></div>
<p>And now, to clean up our history by squashing this last commit with its reference, we use<code>git rebase --autosquash --interactive HEAD~4</code>. Our history is clean now:</p>
<div class="remark-highlight"><pre class="language-text"><code class="language-text">de1e9de feat: add Buttonb3b4932 feat: add Navbareffb3b4 initial commit</code></pre></div>
<p>However, how can we go back to our history pre‑rebase? <code>git reflog</code> shows that when we committed that fix was 4 moves ago <code>HEAD@{4}</code> , while the most recent moves are part of the rebase.</p>
<div class="remark-highlight"><pre class="language-text"><code class="language-text">4610b383 HEAD@{0}: rebase -i (finish): returning to refs/heads/master4610b383 HEAD@{1}: rebase -i (pick): feat: add Navbar52d0c48c HEAD@{2}: rebase -i (fixup): feat: add Navbar07097c96 HEAD@{3}: rebase -i (start): checkout HEAD~4c2149d1 HEAD@{4}: commit: fixup! feat: add Navbar</code></pre></div>
<p>So we can just <code>git reset HEAD@{4}</code> and we have recovered our history pre-squash! This is what <code>git log</code> shows now:</p>
<div class="remark-highlight"><pre class="language-text"><code class="language-text">c2149d1 fixup! feat: add Navbar747ef1e feat: add Button19d9327 feat: add Navbareffb3b4 initial commit</code></pre></div>

<h4>Let’s build a touch-triggered image slider with lazy loading, navigation, and pagination, in one minute.</h4>
<p><img src="/content/blog/omonp-3-building-a-carousel-with-swiper/images/1.png" alt=""></p>
<p><a href="https://codepen.io/jportella93/pen/PoWjaaG">What we will build</a></p>
<hr>
<h4>THE PROBLEM</h4>
<p>We want to implement the classic image carousel present all over the Internet.</p>
<p>Although it seems a pretty easy task to implement ourselves, there are a number of small features and edge cases that actually make the task not so trivial, such as image lazy-loading, looping, and pagination.</p>
<h4>A SOLUTION</h4>
<p>We are going to use a nice little package called <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/swiper">Swiper</a> to implement our carousel quickly.</p>
<h4>1. Import Swiper’s JavaScript and CSS</h4>
<h4>2. Add the layout for Swiper, where basic elements should carry specific class names</h4>
<ul>
<li><code>swiper-container</code> is the main slider container</li>
<li><code>swiper-wrapper</code> is an additional required wrapper</li>
<li><code>swiper-slide</code> is the wrapper for every slide</li>
<li>Optional <code>swiper-pagination</code> is the row of dots on the bottom, each one representing a slide, that can trigger navigation to that specific slide. Also, they have different styling for the currently active slide</li>
<li>Optional <code>swiper-button-prev</code> and <code>swiper-button-next</code> which are the arrows on both sides of the slide</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, for lazy-loading:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add a class of <code>swiper-lazy</code> to images inside <code>swiper-slide</code></li>
<li>Add a placeholder of <code>swiper-lazy-preloader</code> to show if the image hasn’t been loaded yet</li>
<li>Image attribute <code>src</code> should be replaced by <code>data-src</code> to avoid default loading behavior</li>
</ul>
<h4>3. Initialize Swiper on our script file</h4>
<ul>
<li><code>loop</code> makes the last slide go back to the first one and vice-versa</li>
<li><code>lazy.loadPrevNext</code> pre-loads the next image to avoid showing a loading placeholder if possible</li>
<li><code>pagination</code> and <code>navigation</code> sets the configuration for these elements</li>
</ul>
<h4>4. Putting it all together</h4>
<p>Here’s a quick demo on CodePen. You can check the network tab on the browser’s DevTools and you’ll see image requests being done on-demand as you swipe!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>Quick Refactor: Keep Casing in VSCode Search + Replace</h1>
<h2>A simple Visual Studio Code trick to save precious time while refactoring</h2>
<h3>THE PROBLEM</h3>
<p>We have a <code>pet</code> object, whose value under the key of <code>name</code> we are changing. We are saving a reference to the old value that the key <code>name</code> pointed to for logging purposes.</p>
<p>Now we realize that we’d like to rename the key <code>name</code> to <code>alias</code>. A refactoring is in order. So we pull up the find and replace feature by pressing ctrl/cmd + f.</p>
<p>But oops! as they key <code>name</code> is also used in camelCase as part of other variables names <code>newPetName</code> and <code>oldPetName</code> , we get a casing mismatch after replacing. <code>newPetalias</code> and <code>oldPetalias</code> don’t look so good…</p>
<h3>A SOLUTION</h3>
<p>We are going to undo this change and repeat it using the <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/codebasics#_advanced-find-and-replace-options">preserve case option on the find and replace feature</a> by pressing the <code>AB</code> button.</p>
<p>Now we’ve saved time refactoring and our pets are happy with their aliases!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>The One Thing You Need To Know To Avoid CSS Multiline Wrapping</h1>
<h2>10 lines of code to make your text always span one line, and save you from countless headaches</h2>
<h2>THE PROBLEM</h2>
<p>So imagine you have a component that shows some user information like name, surname, and e-mail. The design shows a nice layout where all lines take the same space.</p>
<p>Easy enough, you implement the design and release it into the wild. But then you realize that this UI can break with a person with a longer name.</p>
<p>That’s because the data being shown has <strong>variable length</strong> and you should account for all the cases where it will be used. <a href="https://www.jonportella.com/displaying-data-with-variable-length-example#example-1">Here is a demo with the example.</a></p>
<p>There will be users with super long names, e-mail addresses, and what not and this shouldn’t break your UI.</p>
<h2>THE SOLUTION</h2>
<p>One approach to prevent this would be to create a wrapper component for variable length text which is expected to be shown in a single line. All overflowing text can be scrolled to the side if needed.</p>
<h3><em>OneLineScroller.jsx</em></h3>
<p>Wrapping your text fields with this component makes them span exactly one line. <a href="https://www.jonportella.com/displaying-data-with-variable-length-example#example-2">Check example #2 with the OneLineScroller</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>Spot errors before pushing to save time while reviewing your own pull requests</h4>
<p><img src="/content/blog/master-git-diff-with-these-not-so-known-commands/images/0.png" alt=""></p>
<h4>THE PROBLEM</h4>
<p>You spend a lot of time reviewing your own pull request on Github before asking for a review and you always find stuff that needs to be changed. So you need to add/edit commits, losing lots of time.</p>
<h4>A SOLUTION</h4>
<p>Before committing, make good use of <code>git diff</code>, so you avoid having to change code later.</p>
<p>Here are some not-so-known git tips, sorted from more common to more uncommon:</p>
<h4>Changes on staged or unstaged files</h4>
<ol>
<li>Show all <strong>unstaged</strong> changes since the last commit:</li>
</ol>
<div class="remark-highlight"><pre class="language-shell"><code class="language-shell"><span class="token function">git</span> <span class="token function">diff</span>
</code></pre></div>
<ol start="2">
<li>Show all <strong>staged</strong> changes since the last commit:</li>
</ol>
<div class="remark-highlight"><pre class="language-shell"><code class="language-shell"><span class="token function">git</span> <span class="token function">diff</span> <span class="token parameter variable">--cached</span>
</code></pre></div>
<ol start="3">
<li>Show all <strong>staged and unstaged</strong> changes since the last commit:</li>
</ol>
<div class="remark-highlight"><pre class="language-shell"><code class="language-shell"><span class="token function">git</span> <span class="token function">diff</span> HEAD
</code></pre></div>
<h4>Revision targeting</h4>
<ol>
<li>Show changes <strong>since a specific commit</strong>:</li>
</ol>
<div class="remark-highlight"><pre class="language-shell"><code class="language-shell"><span class="token function">git</span> log <span class="token parameter variable">--oneline</span><span class="token comment"># 4833545 cleanup# c3a1ee6 add navbar# ca2f968 initial commit</span>
</code></pre></div>
<div class="remark-highlight"><pre class="language-shell"><code class="language-shell"><span class="token function">git</span> <span class="token function">diff</span> ca2f968
</code></pre></div>
<ol start="2">
<li>Show changes** since the last n commits**, e.g. 2:</li>
</ol>
<div class="remark-highlight"><pre class="language-shell"><code class="language-shell"><span class="token function">git</span> <span class="token function">diff</span> HEAD~2
</code></pre></div>
<h4>Single file</h4>
<ol>
<li>Show changes on a <strong>single file since the last commit</strong>:</li>
</ol>
<div class="remark-highlight"><pre class="language-javascript"><code class="language-javascript">git diff script<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token property-access">js</span>
</code></pre></div>
<ol start="2">
<li>Show changes on a <strong>single file since a specific commit</strong>:</li>
</ol>
<div class="remark-highlight"><pre class="language-shell"><code class="language-shell"><span class="token function">git</span> log <span class="token parameter variable">--oneline</span><span class="token comment"># 4833545 cleanup# c3a1ee6 add navbar# ca2f968 initial commit</span>
</code></pre></div>
<div class="remark-highlight"><pre class="language-javascript"><code class="language-javascript">git diff ca2f968 script<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token property-access">js</span>
</code></pre></div>
<h4>Summary of changes</h4>
<p>To be run from your feature branch.</p>
<ol>
<li>Show all changes over a specific branch (<strong>GitHub PR diff</strong>):</li>
</ol>
<div class="remark-highlight"><pre class="language-shell"><code class="language-shell"><span class="token function">git</span> <span class="token function">diff</span> master
</code></pre></div>
<ol start="2">
<li>Show <strong>changed files with a number of changed lines</strong> over a specific branch:</li>
</ol>
<div class="remark-highlight"><pre class="language-shell"><code class="language-shell"><span class="token function">git</span> <span class="token function">diff</span> master <span class="token parameter variable">--stat</span>
</code></pre></div>
<ol start="3">
<li>Show a **one-line summary of the changes **over a specific branch:</li>
</ol>
<div class="remark-highlight"><pre class="language-shell"><code class="language-shell"><span class="token function">git</span> <span class="token function">diff</span> master <span class="token parameter variable">--shortstat</span>
</code></pre></div>
<h4>BONUS</h4>
<p>Finally, here’s a neat trick by <a href="https://shime.sh/til/git-diff-tips-and-tricks">Shime.sh</a>, to make your diffs more readable by removing the <code>+</code> and <code>-</code> symbols, since they are colored anyway!</p>
<div class="remark-highlight"><pre class="language-shell"><code class="language-shell"><span class="token function">git</span> config <span class="token parameter variable">--global</span> pager.diff <span class="token string">'sed "s/^\([^-+ ]*\)[-+ ]/\\1/"'</span>
</code></pre></div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>A quick introduction to a library that has better browser support than the loading="lazy" attribute.</h4>
<p><img src="/content/blog/lazy-load-images-with-lazysizes/images/0.png" alt=""></p>
<p><a href="https://codepen.io/jportella93/pen/MWJYeLj">What we will build</a></p>
<hr>
<h4>THE PROBLEM</h4>
<p>The images on our website load all at the same time, including the ones that are not in view, blocking other assets to be downloaded.</p>
<p>This makes our website take longer to load, and** has a bad effect on our UX**.</p>
<h4>A SOLUTION</h4>
<p>We are going to use a nice little package called <a href="https://github.com/aFarkas/lazysizes">LazySizes</a> to make images load only when they are scrolled into view.</p>
<p>To do that we only need to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Replace the <code>src</code> attribute on images with a <code>data-src</code> attribute, so the browser doesn’t download them automatically. Also, this allows LazySizes to take the image source in order to request it when scrolled into view.</li>
<li>Add a class of <code>lazyload</code> to the image, so LazySizes knows it has to act on that element.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here’s a quick demo, scroll to make images appear. You can check the network tab on the browser’s DevTools and you’ll see image requests being done as you scroll!</p>
<p>SImple image lazyloading with LazySizes.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>Save refactor time with one character — Regular expressions on JavaScript or any other language made easier</h4>
<hr>
<h4>THE PROBLEM</h4>
<p>We have a block of HTML code, including a set of images.</p>
<p>All of them have an alt tag, but <strong>we want to add a full stop to every tag</strong>, to make screen readers pause for a bit when reading the tag.</p>
<div class="remark-highlight"><pre class="language-html"><code class="language-html"><span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&#x3C;</span>img</span> <span class="token attr-name">src</span><span class="token attr-value"><span class="token punctuation attr-equals">=</span><span class="token punctuation">"</span>image1.jpg<span class="token punctuation">"</span></span> <span class="token attr-name">alt</span><span class="token attr-value"><span class="token punctuation attr-equals">=</span><span class="token punctuation">"</span>A beautiful sunset<span class="token punctuation">"</span></span> <span class="token punctuation">/></span></span>
<span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&#x3C;</span>img</span> <span class="token attr-name">src</span><span class="token attr-value"><span class="token punctuation attr-equals">=</span><span class="token punctuation">"</span>image2.jpg<span class="token punctuation">"</span></span> <span class="token attr-name">alt</span><span class="token attr-value"><span class="token punctuation attr-equals">=</span><span class="token punctuation">"</span>Mountain landscape<span class="token punctuation">"</span></span> <span class="token punctuation">/></span></span>
<span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&#x3C;</span>img</span> <span class="token attr-name">src</span><span class="token attr-value"><span class="token punctuation attr-equals">=</span><span class="token punctuation">"</span>image3.jpg<span class="token punctuation">"</span></span> <span class="token attr-name">alt</span><span class="token attr-value"><span class="token punctuation attr-equals">=</span><span class="token punctuation">"</span>Ocean waves<span class="token punctuation">"</span></span> <span class="token punctuation">/></span></span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>A set of images with alt tags without full stops.</p>
<p>We could just capture everything between <code>""</code>. However, that would also target the <code>src</code> tag of the first image, since, <strong>by default, RegEx quantifiers aregreedy</strong>, so we are capturing until the last occurrence of <code>"</code> in the line.</p>
<div class="remark-highlight"><pre class="language-regex"><code class="language-regex">alt="<span class="token char-set class-name">.</span><span class="token quantifier number">*</span>"
</code></pre></div>
<p>We wrongly target the src tag of the first image.</p>
<p>How can we do it?</p>
<h4>A SOLUTION</h4>
<p>We are going to use a **RegEx Lazy (or Non-Greedy) Quantifier **to match only the alt tags and add them back with a full stop.</p>
<p>We only need to add a <code>?</code> after the quantifier.</p>
<div class="remark-highlight"><pre class="language-regex"><code class="language-regex">alt="<span class="token char-set class-name">.</span><span class="token quantifier number">*?</span>"
</code></pre></div>
<p>Lazy Quantifier allows us to only target the alt tag.</p>

<p><img src="/content/blog/prevent-hyphen-line-breaks-with-non-breaking-hyphen/images/0.png" alt=""></p>
<hr>
<h4>THE PROBLEM</h4>
<p>Let’s say our company is called Astro-Team, or whatever name with a hyphen.</p>
<p>On our website, the company name gets divided into multiple lines when nearing the end of the line, since <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/hyphens#suggesting_line_break_opportunities">its hyphen is considered by the browser as a line break opportunity</a>.</p>
<p>Hyphen-Minus being used as line-break.</p>
<h4>A SOLUTION</h4>
<p>You could go and wrap every occurrence of the company name with a `` , and that would fix it.</p>
<h4>ANOTHER (CLEANER) SOLUTION</h4>
<p>Replace the <a href="http://v">Hyphen-Minus symbol</a> <code>-</code>, which is the one most commonly found on keyboards, with a <a href="https://unicode-table.com/en/2011/">Non-Breaking Hyphen</a> <code>‑</code> , which looks the same but will avoid line breaks.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Forward Proxy vs. Reverse Proxy</h3>
<h4>Despite having similar names, they serve different purposes. Here’s a quick guide.</h4>
<p><img src="/content/blog/forward-proxy-vs-reverse-proxy/images/0.png" alt=""></p>
<hr>
<p>I came across <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/es-es/learning/cdn/glossary/reverse-proxy/">this really well-explained article from Cloudflare</a> about proxies and wanted to share it with you, in one minute.</p>
<h4>Proxy Server, AKA “Forward Proxy” or just “Proxy”</h4>
<p>A server that sits in front of the client and acts as a middleman. It intercepts the client requests and <strong>forwards</strong> them — hence, the name — on their behalf to another server somewhere on the Internet.</p>
<p><img src="/content/blog/forward-proxy-vs-reverse-proxy/images/1.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Forward Proxy Flow, image by <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare</a>.</p>
<p>Some use cases of a Forward Proxy:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Block access to certain content</strong>. A workplace network might be configured to connect through a proxy, which blocks requests to social media websites.</li>
<li><strong>Avoid state or institutional regulations</strong>. The opposite to the previous example: If your network blocks connections to certain websites, you can do the requests to a proxy outside of that network which will forward the request for you.</li>
<li><strong>Hide the client’s identity</strong>. By connecting to a website through a proxy, you could make your IP address more difficult to trace, since the final server would receive the proxy’s IP address.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to put it into practice, I wrote a story about the subject, covering the last 2 use cases.</p>
<h4>Reverse Proxy</h4>
<p>Is a server that sits in front of one or more web servers and acts as a gatekeeper for incoming requests.</p>
<p><img src="/content/blog/forward-proxy-vs-reverse-proxy/images/2.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Reverse Proxy Flow, image by <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare</a>.</p>
<p>Some use cases of a Reverse Proxy:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Load Balancing</strong>. A Reverse Proxy can distribute incoming requests to available servers to ensure the most efficient handling.</li>
<li><strong>Global Server Load Balancing</strong>. If we have servers in several parts of the world, our Reverse Proxy can forward the client’s request to its closest server, ensuring faster response times.</li>
<li><strong>Content Caching</strong>. By distributing proxies in several parts of the world, we can cache content to achieve faster responses. The first request from a different country will be forwarded to the actual server, but subsequent requests from that country will be quickly answered with the cached content on the local reverse proxy.</li>
<li><strong>Protection from Targeted Attacks</strong>. By using a Reverse Proxy, the IP of our final server is never revealed, making it harder for attackers to target them with attacks such as DDoS attacks.</li>
<li><strong>Efficient encryption</strong>. Instead of handling computationally expensive encryptions and decryptions from our server, we can delegate that task to the reverse proxy.</li>
</ul>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>Or how Static Code Analysis Tools make your life and prevent headaches</h4>
<p><img src="/content/blog/avoid-headaches-with-static-code-analysis-tools/images/0.png" alt=""></p>
<hr>
<h4>THE PROBLEM</h4>
<p>Take a moment to look at this snippet and try to figure out what it does.</p>
<p>Don’t scroll to the solution yet!</p>
<p>Really try to figure out the result, It’s not as easy as it seems…</p>
<p>What will be logged in line 4?</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Don’t scroll anymore until you know the solution!</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>OK, ready?</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Now, I bet you thought the result was:</p>
<div class="remark-highlight"><pre class="language-text"><code class="language-text">```text
&#x26;#39;Swapped: 2,1&#x26;#39;</code></pre></div>
<p><strong>WRONG.</strong></p>
<p>This code throws an error. You can try it yourself on your browser’s console:</p>
<div class="remark-highlight"><pre class="language-text"><code class="language-text">```text
Uncaught TypeError: Cannot set property &#x26;#39;2&#x26;#39; of undefined</code></pre></div>
<p>But, why?</p>
<p>This error happened to one of my students and I was puzzled for a while until I discovered the culprit. <strong>The code is missing semicolons</strong>. Usually, this is not a problem, since <a href="https://262.ecma-international.org/7.0/#sec-automatic-semicolon-insertion">JavaScript’s Automatic Semicolon Insertion</a> takes good care of it.</p>
<p>However, in this case, the code is run as:</p>
<p>How the example program is actually run.</p>
<p>How can we avoid this kind of headache?</p>
<h4>A SOLUTION</h4>
<p>Use <a href="https://blog.logrocket.com/static-analysis-in-javascript-11-tools-to-help-you-catch-errors-before-users-do/">static code analysis tools</a>.</p>
<p>Even if it’s a small script that I’m working on, I always install, at least, <code>eslint</code>. Because:</p>
<ol>
<li>It will point out this kind of problem and others.</li>
<li>It will solve those problems and format your code automatically on save, as that’s what the configuration on your IDE should do. In the end, that task should be the work of robots, not humans!</li>
</ol>
<p>So even if it takes a couple of minutes to set up static code analysis tools, it is always a big win. Moreover, the more times you set them up, the faster you can get it done the next time.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[Learn how to remove all your node_modules directories, in one minute.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>Here’s my one-liner to delete all the JavaScript dependencies of a repo in a flash.</h4>
<p><img src="/content/blog/remove-all-node-modules-directories-at-once/images/0.png" alt=""></p>
<h4>THE PROBLEM</h4>
<p>You want to do a backup of all your current files because you’re switching computers.</p>
<p>Some of your local repositories have unpublished branches so you want to copy them over to your new machine rather than checking out their remote versions.</p>
<p>However, the gazillion files inside node_modules make copying the repo take 2 hours. You don’t want to go on every directory and delete the folder manually.</p>
<p>What do you do?</p>
<h4>A SOLUTION</h4>
<p>We are going to use Unix's <code>find</code> to look for <code>node_modules</code> folders in our repositories directory, and then we are going to use <code>xargs</code> to pass these paths to <code>rm</code>.</p>
<ol>
<li>Go into your repositories directory:</li>
</ol>
<div class="remark-highlight"><pre class="language-shell"><code class="language-shell"><span class="token builtin class-name">cd</span> 
</code></pre></div>
<ol start="2">
<li>List the <code>node_modules</code> directories you are going to remove:</li>
</ol>
<div class="remark-highlight"><pre class="language-css"><code class="language-css">find . -type d -name node_modules
</code></pre></div>
<div class="remark-highlight"><pre class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token comment"># ./example-repo/node_modules# ./example-repo/node_modules/node-libs-browser/node_modules# ...</span>
</code></pre></div>
<ol start="3">
<li>Let’s use <code>xargs</code> to pass these paths to <code>rm</code> :</li>
</ol>
<div class="remark-highlight"><pre class="language-css"><code class="language-css">find . -type d -name node_modules | xargs rm -rf
</code></pre></div>
<ol start="4">
<li>Done! let’s double-check that all the <code>node_modules</code> have been deleted:</li>
</ol>
<div class="remark-highlight"><pre class="language-css"><code class="language-css">find . -type d -name node_modules
</code></pre></div>
<div class="remark-highlight"><pre class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token comment"># Empty</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Now copying over our repositories directory to our new machine takes just a second, and we can run <code>npm install</code> to generate a new <code>node_modules</code> directory.</p>

<p><a href="https://codepen.io/jportella93/pen/eYBxdzv">What we are going to build</a></p>
<h4>THE PROBLEM</h4>
<p>The payment form on our website looks a little bit dull. Customers get bored and don’t input their card details. How can we make it more engaging?</p>
<p>Our boring static card.</p>
<hr>
<h4>A SOLUTION</h4>
<p>We are going to use <a href="https://github.com/micku7zu/vanilla-tilt.js/">Vanilla-tilt.js</a> to make our card move in 3 dimensions when hovering it with our mouse or tilting our handheld device.</p>
<p>It is really simple:</p>
<ol>
<li>Import it in our project</li>
</ol>
<div class="remark-highlight"><pre class="language-shell"><code class="language-shell"><span class="token function">npm</span> <span class="token function">install</span> vanilla-tilt
</code></pre></div>
<p>or import it from a CDN as in the example:</p>
<div class="remark-highlight"><pre class="language-javascript"><code class="language-javascript"><span class="token keyword module">import</span> <span class="token imports">vanillaTilt</span> <span class="token keyword module">from</span> <span class="token string">"https://cdn.skypack.dev/vanilla-tilt@1.7.0"</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
</code></pre></div>
<ol start="2">
<li>Target a DOM element as a Vanilla-tilt container. The second argument is the <a href="https://github.com/micku7zu/vanilla-tilt.js/#options">options</a> object.</li>
</ol>
<div class="remark-highlight"><pre class="language-javascript"><code class="language-javascript"><span class="token keyword">const</span> card <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token dom variable">document</span><span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token method function property-access">querySelector</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">"#card"</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span><span class="token maybe-class-name">VanillaTilt</span><span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token method function property-access">init</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>card<span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>  <span class="token literal-property property">max</span><span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token number">10</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span>  <span class="token literal-property property">speed</span><span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token number">1000</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span>  <span class="token literal-property property">perspective</span><span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token number">700</span><span class="token punctuation">}</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>

<p>And that’s really it! Here is our final result:</p>
<p>Our cool cat 3D moving card! Let’s spend all our $$!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>A one-liner to count lines, words, and characters on any repo</h4>
<p><img src="/content/blog/count-total-lines-in-a-git-repository/images/0.png" alt=""></p>
<h4>THE PROBLEM</h4>
<p>Our engineering manager has asked us about the total number of lines on several repositories of the company. How can we find out that information?</p>
<h4>A SOLUTION</h4>
<p>We are going to use the command <code>git ls-files</code> and <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/piping-in-unix-or-linux/">pipe</a> its output to<code>wc</code> using <code>xargs</code> .</p>
<ol>
<li>As a repository example, we are going to create a new project using <a href="https://github.com/pankod/superplate">superplate</a>.</li>
</ol>
<div class="remark-highlight"><pre class="language-shell"><code class="language-shell">npx superplate-cli my-app
</code></pre></div>
<ol start="2">
<li>Once created, we are going into the repo directory.</li>
</ol>
<div class="remark-highlight"><pre class="language-shell"><code class="language-shell"><span class="token builtin class-name">cd</span> my-app
</code></pre></div>
<ol start="3">
<li>Now we can run <code>git ls-files</code> to recursively see all the files versioned in the repo.</li>
</ol>
<div class="remark-highlight"><pre class="language-shell"><code class="language-shell"><span class="token function">git</span> ls-files
</code></pre></div>
<div class="remark-highlight"><pre class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token comment"># .babelrc# .eslintignore# .eslintrc# .gitattributes# ...</span>
</code></pre></div>
<ol start="4">
<li>However we want to also see the number of lines on every file. We are going to <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/piping-in-unix-or-linux/">pipe</a> the output of <code>git ls-files</code> to <code>wc</code> using <code>xargs</code> .</li>

<div class="remark-highlight"><pre class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token comment">#       1       4      30 .babelrc#       1       2      26 .eslintignore#      25      37     600 .eslintrc#       1       2      12 .gitattributes# ...#   25891   49458 1219057 total</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Here we see:</p>
<ul>
<li>1st column: number of <strong>lines</strong> in that file**.**</li>
<li>2nd column: number of <strong>words</strong> in that file.</li>
<li>3rd column: number of <strong>characters</strong> in that file.</li>
</ul>
<p>And in the last row, information on the total of files.</p>
<p><strong>So our repo has25891 lines</strong>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>A tutorial on firing a callback function when an element enters the viewport</h4>
<p><img src="/content/blog/track-user-scroll-with-intersectionobserver/images/0.png" alt=""></p>
<h4>The problem</h4>
<p>Our website has a new and shiny landing page. We are getting lots of visits, so the marketing team has asked us to track how many of those visitors scroll down to the Call To Action section.</p>
<p>How can we do that?</p>
<h4>A solution</h4>
<p>Use <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IntersectionObserver">window.IntersectionObserver</a> to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Detect when the section enters the viewport.</li>
<li>Fire a callback that will log that event on our analytics software e.g. <a href="https://usefathom.com/">Fathom</a>, <a href="https://matomo.org/">Matomo</a>, <a href="https://analytics.google.com/">Google Analytics</a>.</li>
<li>Disconnect the observer to avoid logging the event more than once.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here’s a demo:</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>Make faster refactors in JavaScript, VSCode, or in your favourite place to run regular expressions</h4>
<p><img src="/content/blog/using-regex-negative-lookahead-to-replace-http-with-https/images/0.png" alt=""></p>
<hr>
<h4>THE PROBLEM</h4>
<p>We have a list of images, some of them being requested via the HTTP protocol and some others via the HTTPS protocol.</p>
<p>A list of images with mixed HTTP and HTTPS.</p>
<p>We want all of them to use HTTPS.</p>
<p>How can we accomplish this? Just replacing <code>http</code> for <code>https</code> results in undesired <code>httpss</code> .</p>
<p>Just replacing <code>http for https produces httpss.</code></p>
<p>So we only want to match and update <code>http</code> that is not followed by an <code>s</code> . How do we do that?</p>
<h4>A SOLUTION</h4>
<p>Enter <strong>Regex’s Negative Lookahead</strong>. The syntax is simple:</p>
<div class="remark-highlight"><pre class="language-text"><code class="language-text">http(?!s)</code></pre></div>
<p>Where:</p>
<ul>
<li>The parentheses followed by a question mark and exclamation point <code>(?!)</code> is the construct for the Negative Lookahead.</li>
<li>Characters between the exclamation point and the closing parentheses are the ones negated. In this case, we are only negating the character <code>s</code> .</li>
</ul>
<p>Here’s a demo on <a href="http://regexr.com/5o95i">RegExr</a>.</p>
<p>So our solution would be:</p>
<p>Using Regex’s Negative Lookahead, we can match http and not https.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[A tutorial on setting a VPN and using it from the CLI to hide our IP and location]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="/content/blog/how-to-use-a-vpn-to-change-your-public-ip-address-from-the-command-line/images/0.png" alt=""></p>
<hr>
<h4>THE PROBLEM</h4>
<p>You may already know which location information are we sharing with websites when we interact with them, such our IP Address. So, wouldn't it be great if we could hide it or even change it?</p>
<p>Why? here’s a handful of use cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>You don’t want the website you’re interacting with, your Internet Service Provider, or even your country’s government to know who’s the person interacting with that website.</li>
<li>You want to make it look like your connection comes from a different country since there aresome online services that will charge you differently depending on your country of origin. Or content that just won’t be available in your country in streaming services.</li>
<li>You want to look like a different individual, for example, if your IP has been blocked.</li>
</ul>
<p>So how can we change our public IP address?</p>
<h4>THE SOLUTION</h4>
<p>With a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network"><strong>V</strong>irtual <strong>P</strong>rivate <strong>N</strong>etwork (VPN)</a>. Basically, you’ll be doing requests to the VPN’s server and that server will do the actual request for you, hiding your IP address to the final server.</p>
<p>There are several VPN providers out there, it’s a growing market. I’m going to explain how to use the one that has been more useful for me: Windscribe.</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to <a href="https://windscribe.com/">Windscribe</a> and create a free account. If you want, you can use my <a href="https://windscribe.com/yo/kocmap80">referral link</a> so we both get 1GB/month for free.</li>
<li>To install the CLI in MacOS you can use <a href="https://formulae.brew.sh/cask/windscribe">homebrew</a> and skip to step #5. To do it in Ubuntu add the Windscribe signing key to apt:</li>
</ol>
<div class="remark-highlight"><pre class="language-shell"><code class="language-shell"><span class="token function">sudo</span> apt-key adv <span class="token parameter variable">--keyserver</span> keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-key FDC247B7
</code></pre></div>
<ol start="3">
<li>Add the repository to your <code>sources.list</code>:</li>
</ol>
<div class="remark-highlight"><pre class="language-shell"><code class="language-shell"><span class="token builtin class-name">echo</span> <span class="token string">'deb https://repo.windscribe.com/ubuntu bionic main'</span> <span class="token operator">|</span> <span class="token function">sudo</span> <span class="token function">tee</span> /etc/apt/sources.list.d/windscribe-repo.list
</code></pre></div>
<ol start="4">
<li>Update apt-get and install <code>windscribe-cli</code>:</li>
</ol>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>A tutorial on setting a VPN and using it from the CLI to hide our IP and location</h4>
<p><img src="/content/blog/how-to-use-a-vpn-to-change-your-public-ip-address-from-the-command-line-2/images/0.png" alt=""></p>
<hr>
<h4>THE PROBLEM</h4>
<p>If you read issue #8, you already know which location information are we sharing with websites when we interact with them. If you didn't, take a quick read first.</p>
<p>So following up, now that we know about our public IP Address, it would be great if we could hide it or even change it.</p>
<p>Why? here’s a handful of use cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>You don’t want the website you’re interacting with, your Internet Service Provider, or even your country’s government to know who’s the person interacting with that website.</li>
<li>You want to make it look like your connection comes from a different country since there aresome online services that will charge you differently depending on your country of origin. Or content that just won’t be available in your country in streaming services.</li>
<li>You want to look like a different individual, for example, if your IP has been blocked.</li>
</ul>
<p>So how can we change our public IP address?</p>
<h4>THE SOLUTION</h4>
<p>With a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network"><strong>V</strong>irtual <strong>P</strong>rivate <strong>N</strong>etwork (VPN)</a>. Basically, you’ll be doing requests to the VPN’s server and that server will do the actual request for you, hiding your IP address to the final server.</p>
<p>There are several VPN providers out there, it’s a growing market. I’m going to explain how to use the one that has been more useful for me: Windscribe.</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to <a href="https://windscribe.com/">Windscribe</a> and create a free account. If you want, you can use my <a href="https://windscribe.com/yo/kocmap80">referral link</a> so we both get 1GB/month for free.</li>
<li>To install the CLI in MacOS you can use <a href="https://formulae.brew.sh/cask/windscribe">homebrew</a> and skip to step #5. To do it in Ubuntu add the Windscribe signing key to apt:</li>
</ol>
<div class="remark-highlight"><pre class="language-css"><code class="language-css">sudo apt-key adv <span class="token variable">--keyserver</span> keyserver.ubuntu.com <span class="token variable">--recv-key</span> FDC247B7
</code></pre></div>
<ol start="3">
<li>Add the repository to your <code>sources.list</code>:</li>
</ol>
<div class="remark-highlight"><pre class="language-shell"><code class="language-shell"><span class="token builtin class-name">echo</span> <span class="token string">'deb https://repo.windscribe.com/ubuntu bionic main'</span> <span class="token operator">|</span> <span class="token function">sudo</span> <span class="token function">tee</span> /etc/apt/sources.list.d/windscribe-repo.list

<li>Update apt-get and install <code>windscribe-cli</code>:</li>

<h4>THE PROBLEM</h4>
<p>You get a new computer, you back up all your files but…</p>
<p>OH! you forgot to back up your <code>~/.bashrc</code> or <code>~/.zshrc</code> where all your custom aliases and functions live! Now you need to start over with them…</p>
<h4>A SOLUTION</h4>
<p>To save you this headache, I’m sharing my super-useful custom alias for updating my shell config that does the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Opens your shell config file.</li>
<li>Saves a copy of the updated file on a secret <a href="https://gist.github.com/">Github Gist</a>.</li>
<li>Refreshes your shell session so you can use the updated command right away.</li>
</ol>
<p>Let’s set it up.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This tutorial assumes you’re using <a href="https://www.zsh.org/">zsh</a>. If your are using <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/">bash</a>, just replace <code>zsh</code> and <code>.zshrc</code> by <code>bash</code> and <code>.bashrc</code> in the next commands. You can find out which shell you’re using by running <code>echo $0</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Let’s create a secret <a href="https://gist.github.com/">gist</a> where our config will be saved:</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="/content/blog/autosave-your-shell-config-in-a-git-hub-gist/images/1.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Creating a secret <a href="https://gist.github.com/">Gist</a>.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>Copy the Gist identifier from the URL, the last part. In my case the URL is <code>https://gist.github.com/jportella93/616c872593daf91781d6842c9829b1f0</code> so I’m copying <code>616c872593daf91781d6842c9829b1f0</code> .</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In your <code>~/.zshrc</code> include this line:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<div class="remark-highlight"><pre class="language-shell"><code class="language-shell"><span class="token builtin class-name">alias</span> <span class="token assign-left variable">zshrc</span><span class="token operator">=</span><span class="token string">"gedit ~/.zshrc &#x26;&#x26; \</span>
<span class="token string">gist-paste -u 616c872593daf91781d6842c9829b1f0 ~/.zshrc &#x26;&#x26; \</span>
<span class="token string">exec zsh"</span>
</code></pre></div>
<blockquote>
<p>I’m using <a href="https://help.gnome.org/users/gedit/stable/">gedit</a> as text editor but you can use any other like <code>nano</code>, <code>vim</code> or <code>code</code> . Then replace the gist identifier <code>616c872593daf91781d6842c9829b1f0</code> with the one you copied in the previous step.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="4">
<li>
<p>If you haven’t already, install <a href="https://github.com/defunkt/gist">gist</a> to be able to interact with Github Gist from the CLI.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now you’re all set! When you want to update an alias in your <code>~/.zshrc</code> just type <code>zshrc</code> in your CLI, make changes on your text editor, and changes will be backed up on the Gist automatically. Moreover, you’ll be able to use your updated alias right away! How cool is that?</p>
</li>
</ol>

<hr>
<h4>THE PROBLEM</h4>
<p>Every device connected to the Internet has an assigned IP Address (Internet Protocol Address), which is made up of 4 numbers in the following format: <code>&#x3C;number>.&#x3C;number>.&#x3C;number>.&#x3C;number></code>. Each number can be in the range of 0–255. e.g. <code>184.152.81.47</code> .</p>
<p>When computers communicate with each other over the Internet or via a local network, the information sharing is done through IP addresses. Like physical addresses, they offer a location to send information to.</p>
<p>Your <strong>public IP address</strong> is an external-facing IP Address that’s provided by your Internet Service Provider (ISP).</p>
<p>So we are sharing this valuable piece of information with every website we interact on the Internet, which can be used to identify us and our country of origin…</p>
<p>But, how can we <strong>find out our Public IP address from the command line</strong>?</p>
<h4>A SOLUTION</h4>
<p>Here’s a one-liner using the free service from <code>api.ipify.org</code>:</p>
<div class="remark-highlight"><pre class="language-shell"><code class="language-shell"><span class="token function">curl</span> <span class="token parameter variable">-w</span> <span class="token string">"<span title="\n" class="token entity">\n</span>"</span> <span class="token parameter variable">-s</span> https://api.ipify.org
<span class="token comment"># 116.164.32.81</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>For our comfort, let’s save this in an <a href="https://www.unixtutorial.org/create-alias-in-unix-shell/">alias</a> our or <code>~/.bashrc</code> or <code>~/.zshrc</code>:</p>
<div class="remark-highlight"><pre class="language-shell"><code class="language-shell"><span class="token builtin class-name">alias</span> <span class="token assign-left variable">whatsmyip</span><span class="token operator">=</span><span class="token string">'curl -w "\n" -s https://api.ipify.org'</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p><strong>Now that we know our public IP address, let’s find out its country of origin.</strong> We can pipe the alias result to another free service <code>ipinfo.io</code> that does a geo lookup:</p>
<div class="remark-highlight"><pre class="language-shell"><code class="language-shell"><span class="token function">curl</span> ipinfo.io/<span class="token variable"><span class="token variable">$(</span>whatsmyip<span class="token variable">)</span></span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Even better, also save an alias for this:</p>
<div class="remark-highlight"><pre class="language-shell"><code class="language-shell"><span class="token builtin class-name">alias</span> <span class="token assign-left variable">whatsmycountry</span><span class="token operator">=</span><span class="token string">'curl ipinfo.io/`whatsmyip`'</span>
</code></pre></div>

<h4>THE PROBLEM</h4>
<p>You are saving <a href="https://gist.github.com/">Github Gists</a> often but you spend too much time on their UI.</p>
<h4>A SOLUTION</h4>
<p>Let’s do it from our CLI!</p>
<ol>
<li>Install <a href="https://github.com/defunkt/gist">Gist</a> following the <a href="https://github.com/defunkt/gist#installation">instructions for your system</a>. In my case is Ubuntu so:</li>
</ol>
<div class="remark-highlight"><pre class="language-shell"><code class="language-shell"><span class="token function">sudo</span> <span class="token function">apt</span> <span class="token function">install</span> gist
</code></pre></div>
<ol start="2">
<li>Go to the <a href="https://github.com/settings/tokens">tokens section in GitHub</a> and press on “Generate new token”. Input your password in the next screen:</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="/content/blog/use-gist-paste-to-save-text-files-as-git-hub-gists-from-the-command-line/images/1.png" alt=""></p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Set a name for your token and make sure to check the <code>gist</code> and <code>user:email</code> permissions:</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="/content/blog/use-gist-paste-to-save-text-files-as-git-hub-gists-from-the-command-line/images/2.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Set a name for your token like <code>gist.</code></p>
<p><img src="/content/blog/use-gist-paste-to-save-text-files-as-git-hub-gists-from-the-command-line/images/3.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Check <strong>gist</strong> and <strong>user:email</strong> permissions.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Copy your generated token:</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="/content/blog/use-gist-paste-to-save-text-files-as-git-hub-gists-from-the-command-line/images/4.png" alt=""></p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Save the token in <code>~/.gist</code>. The <code>umask</code> ensures that the file is only accessible from your user account:</li>
</ol>
<div class="remark-highlight"><pre class="language-shell"><code class="language-shell"><span class="token punctuation">(</span>umask 0077 <span class="token operator">&#x26;&#x26;</span> <span class="token builtin class-name">echo</span> MY_SECRET_TOKEN <span class="token operator">></span> ~/.gist<span class="token punctuation">)</span>
</code></pre></div>
<ol start="6">
<li>Check that it has been saved correctly:</li>
</ol>
<div class="remark-highlight"><pre class="language-shell"><code class="language-shell"><span class="token function">cat</span> ~/.gist
</code></pre></div>
<ol start="7">
<li>Now we can create gists from the command line!</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Note that in Ubuntu/Debian the <code>gist</code> command is renamed to <code>gist-paste</code> to avoid conflicts, if you are using a different system like MacOS just replace <code>gist-paste</code> for <code>gist</code> in the next snippet.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="remark-highlight"><pre class="language-shell"><code class="language-shell"><span class="token builtin class-name">echo</span> <span class="token string">"hello gist"</span> <span class="token operator">>></span> gist.txt
gist-paste gist.txt
<span class="token comment"># Returns URL of newly created gist https://gist.github.com/eb36806673aca3c63686078d584e2a2e</span>

<p>Now, instead of copy-pasting it over and over, it would be great if we could store it on the browser so when we want to use it we can retrieve it and run it easily.</p>

<h4>The problem</h4>
<p>We want to log in to the console this deeply nested JavaScript Object:</p>
<div class="remark-highlight"><pre class="language-js"><code class="language-js"><span class="token keyword">const</span> person <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>

        <span class="token literal-property property">age</span><span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token number">26</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span>
        <span class="token literal-property property">friend</span><span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>
            <span class="token literal-property property">name</span><span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token string">'Peter'</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span>
            <span class="token literal-property property">age</span><span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token number">39</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span>

        <span class="token punctuation">}</span>
    <span class="token punctuation">}</span>
<span class="token punctuation">}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<h4>A Naive Solution</h4>
<p>The common beginner mistake is to just put it through the most basic logging tool that the language provides: <code>console.log</code>. However, we have limited depth logging, making<code>friend</code> on the third level just appear as <code>[Object]</code>:</p>
<p><img src="/content/blog/the-right-way-to-log-objects-in-node-js/images/1.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Console.log: Hidden third level as <code>friend: [Object].</code></p>
<h4>A Hacky Solution</h4>
<p>A trick I’ve used in the past is to put it through JSON.stringify with two extra arguments:</p>
<div class="remark-highlight"><pre class="language-js"><code class="language-js"><span class="token console class-name">console</span><span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token method function property-access">log</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token known-class-name class-name">JSON</span><span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token method function property-access">stringify</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>person<span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token keyword null nil">null</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token number">2</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>You can read about what these do in <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/stringify">MDN</a>.</p>
<p>But this approach carries some problems:</p>
<ol>
<li>Functions will disappear from the output.</li>
<li>You won’t get syntax highlighting, as you’re basically logging a formatted string.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="/content/blog/the-right-way-to-log-objects-in-node-js/images/2.png" alt=""></p>
<p>JSON.stringify: no colors and… where’s is <code>sayHi()</code>??</p>
<h4><strong>A (BETTER) SOLUTION</strong></h4>
<p>Use</p>
<div class="remark-highlight"><pre class="language-js"><code class="language-js"><span class="token console class-name">console</span><span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token method function property-access">dir</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>person<span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span><span class="token literal-property property">depth</span><span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token keyword null nil">null</span><span class="token punctuation">}</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>That will show all nested objects, including functions, with syntax highlighting.</p>

<h4>THE PROBLEM</h4>
<p>We have to create a script that will do a GET request to the Chuck Norris jokes API and append that content to a div with the id <code>#chucky</code>.</p>
<p>A quick and easy way to do this would be chaining <code>.then</code> methods on the promises returned by <code>fetch</code> and <code>.json</code> :</p>
<div class="remark-highlight"><pre class="language-js"><code class="language-js"><span class="token function">fetch</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">'https://api.chucknorris.io/jokes/random'</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span>
    <span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token method function property-access">then</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token parameter">response</span> <span class="token arrow operator">=></span> response<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token method function property-access">json</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span>
    <span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token method function property-access">then</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token parameter"><span class="token punctuation">{</span> value <span class="token punctuation">}</span></span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token arrow operator">=></span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>
        <span class="token dom variable">document</span><span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token method function property-access">querySelector</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">'#chucky'</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token property-access">textContent</span> <span class="token operator">=</span> value
    <span class="token punctuation">}</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Let’s refactor it to a more readable <code>async/await</code>. Now, the problem is that <code>await</code> doesn’t work unless it’s used inside an <code>async</code>function:</p>
<div class="remark-highlight"><pre class="language-js"><code class="language-js"><span class="token comment">// Uncaught SyntaxError: await is only valid in async function</span>
<span class="token keyword">const</span> response <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token keyword control-flow">await</span> <span class="token function">fetch</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">'https://api.chucknorris.io/jokes/random'</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span>
<span class="token keyword">const</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>value<span class="token punctuation">}</span> <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token keyword control-flow">await</span> response<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token method function property-access">json</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span>

<span class="token dom variable">document</span><span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token method function property-access">querySelector</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">'#chucky'</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token property-access">textContent</span> <span class="token operator">=</span> value
</code></pre></div>
<p>So a common pattern is to just wrap the async code in an <code>async</code> function and call it immediately. But we are polluting the namespace by adding this new <code>go</code> function which we call immediately:</p>
<div class="remark-highlight"><pre class="language-js"><code class="language-js"><span class="token keyword">async</span> <span class="token keyword">function</span> <span class="token function">go</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>
    <span class="token keyword">const</span> response <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token keyword control-flow">await</span> <span class="token function">fetch</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">'https://api.chucknorris.io/jokes/random'</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span>
    <span class="token keyword">const</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span> value <span class="token punctuation">}</span> <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token keyword control-flow">await</span> response<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token method function property-access">json</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span>

    <span class="token dom variable">document</span><span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token method function property-access">querySelector</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">'#chucky'</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token property-access">textContent</span> <span class="token operator">=</span> value
<span class="token punctuation">}</span>

<span class="token function">go</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span>
</code></pre></div>
<h4>A SOLUTION</h4>
<p>So here’s a quick trick I’ve used in a job interview in the past.</p>
<p>We can do exactly the same in one step and without polluting the namespace with an Async <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/IIFE">Immediately Invoked Function Expression</a>:</p>
<div class="remark-highlight"><pre class="language-js"><code class="language-js"><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token keyword">async</span> <span class="token keyword">function</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>
    <span class="token keyword">const</span> response <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token keyword control-flow">await</span> <span class="token function">fetch</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">'https://api.chucknorris.io/jokes/random'</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span>
    <span class="token keyword">const</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span> value <span class="token punctuation">}</span> <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token keyword control-flow">await</span> response<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token method function property-access">json</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span>
    <span class="token dom variable">document</span><span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token method function property-access">querySelector</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">'#chucky'</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token property-access">textContent</span> <span class="token operator">=</span> value
<span class="token punctuation">}</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>

<h4>THE PROBLEM</h4>
<p>We have a <code>pet</code> object, whose value under the key of <code>name</code> we are changing. We are saving a reference to the old value that the key <code>name</code> pointed to for logging purposes.</p>
<p><img src="/content/blog/quick-refactor-keep-casing-in-vs-code-search-replace/images/1.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Now we realize that we’d like to rename the key <code>name</code> to <code>alias</code>. A refactoring is in order. So we pull up the find and replace feature by pressing ctrl/cmd + f.</p>
<p><img src="/content/blog/quick-refactor-keep-casing-in-vs-code-search-replace/images/2.png" alt=""></p>
<p>But oops! as they key <code>name</code> is also used in camelCase as part of other variables names <code>newPetName</code> and <code>oldPetName</code> , we get a casing mismatch after replacing. <code>newPetalias</code> and <code>oldPetalias</code> don’t look so good…</p>
<p><img src="/content/blog/quick-refactor-keep-casing-in-vs-code-search-replace/images/3.png" alt=""></p>
<h4>A SOLUTION</h4>
<p>We are going to undo this change and repeat it using the <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/codebasics#_advanced-find-and-replace-options">preserve case option on the find and replace feature</a> by pressing the <code>AB</code> button.</p>
<p><img src="/content/blog/quick-refactor-keep-casing-in-vs-code-search-replace/images/4.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Now we’ve saved time refactoring and our pets are happy with their aliases!</p>

<h4>THE PROBLEM</h4>
<p>Using your dev tools to tinker with CSS is great because you get immediate feedback on the changes. However, if the page is refreshed, all those changes get lost in oblivion…</p>
<h4>A SOLUTION</h4>
<p>Here’s a quick tip to persist those changes without affecting your original source files.</p>
<ol>
<li>Open Chrome’s dev tools.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="/content/blog/persist-css-changes-done-in-chrome-s-dev-tools/images/1.png" alt=""></p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Press ctrl/cmd + shift + p to show <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/command-menu">Chrome’s dev tools command menu</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="/content/blog/persist-css-changes-done-in-chrome-s-dev-tools/images/2.png" alt=""></p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Type “show overrides”.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="/content/blog/persist-css-changes-done-in-chrome-s-dev-tools/images/3.png" alt=""></p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Tap on “+ Select folder for overrides” on the left side and select a folder on your machine. That’s where your overrides will live.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="/content/blog/persist-css-changes-done-in-chrome-s-dev-tools/images/4.png" alt=""></p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Allow Chrome to access this folder by tapping “Allow” on the bar that appears below the search bar.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="/content/blog/persist-css-changes-done-in-chrome-s-dev-tools/images/5.png" alt=""></p>
<ol start="6">
<li>Now the folder has appeared on the “Overrides” section.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="/content/blog/persist-css-changes-done-in-chrome-s-dev-tools/images/6.png" alt=""></p>
<ol start="7">
<li>Let’s try it! Change some styles in the “Elements” panel. You’ll see a purplish dot next to the stylesheet file name, which means it has been saved locally in our overrides folder. Refreshing the page will keep that change!</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="/content/blog/persist-css-changes-done-in-chrome-s-dev-tools/images/7.png" alt=""></p>
<ol start="8">
<li>Now back in the “Overrides” tab, we can see those local overrides, sorted by URL folders.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="/content/blog/persist-css-changes-done-in-chrome-s-dev-tools/images/8.png" alt=""></p>
<ol start="9">
<li>(BONUS!) To see the diff between your source code and the local overrides, you can type “Show changes” on the command menu.</li>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="/content/blog/using-java-script-to-test-browser-support-for-a-css-pseudo-class/images/0.png" alt=""></p>
<hr>
<h4>THE PROBLEM</h4>
<p>Some browsers have native support for pseudo-elements that others don’t. This is the case, for example, of <code>::ms-reveal</code> , the little eye that appears to show/hide password input fields in Microsoft browsers (Internet Explorer and Edge).</p>
<p><img src="/content/blog/using-java-script-to-test-browser-support-for-a-css-pseudo-class/images/1.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Edge’s native password reveal feature.</p>
<p>The problem with this native feature is that if your front-end has its own password reveal feature, you could end up with a layout like this one:</p>
<p><img src="/content/blog/using-java-script-to-test-browser-support-for-a-css-pseudo-class/images/2.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Oops! Edge’s native password reveal feature and our own’s.</p>
<h4>A SOLUTION</h4>
<p>A quick fix would be to just hide the native reveal password:</p>
<div class="remark-highlight"><pre class="language-css"><code class="language-css"><span class="token selector"><span class="token pseudo-element">::-ms-reveal</span></span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>
  <span class="token property">display</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> none<span class="token punctuation">;</span>
<span class="token punctuation">}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>But why are we so quick to discard a native feature? They’re great! In the end, those are the ones that have been developed and tested to work flawlessly by the same team that has built the browser.</p>
<h4>A (NATIVE FRIENDLY) SOLUTION</h4>
<p>So in this case, a good approach would be to test if the browser has the<code>::ms-reveal</code> feature, and only show our own if it doesn’t.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>The Ugliest 6 Reasons To Not Enroll In A Coding Boot Camp</h3>
<h4>Here’s my experience as a top European coding boot camp graduate</h4>
<p><img src="/content/blog/the-ugliest-6-reasons-to-not-enrol-in-a-coding-bootcamp/images/0.png" alt=""></p>
<p>There are some ugly partsof coding boot camps that people don’t talk about.</p>
<p>In this article, I’m going to give you a global vision about the possible dangers of enrolling in these courses, with the objective ofhelping you decide whether to do a boot camp or not.</p>
<p>About me — Two years ago graduated from <a href="https://codeworks.me/">Codeworks</a>, which is currently the <a href="https://www.switchup.org/rankings/best-coding-bootcamps">top 5 best valued Software Engineering boot camp in the world</a>. It was a great experience for me. And besides the software developer job that I landed shortly after graduating from the course, once a week I’m also teaching new software devs in that same boot camp as an instructor.</p>
<p>This experience has shown me some of the dangers of coding boot camps from several perspectives, both as a student and as an instructor. Those that don’t appear in promo material:</p>
<hr>
<h3>1. There’s just too much info to take in such a short time</h3>
<p>In three months you are expected from going to knowing nothing in computer science to being familiar with JavaScript, HTML, CSS, data structures, algorithms, Git, web servers, databases, ORMs, web security… and that’s just to name a few.</p>
<p>The worst part is that it seems that you can never keep up with the new concepts, so some students break down.</p>
<p>However, in my experience, I didn’t fully understand all the concepts as they were being thrown to me, but I kept pushing and everything fell into place by the end of the course. Seems counterintuitive, but the knowledge gap starts closing after the course, and when you start working.</p>
<hr>
<h3>2. Drop Outs — People that don’t make it</h3>
<p>I’ve seen a couple in these two years but is not common. Generally, if you get admitted to the course — and that’s a big if — you are capable of completing it.</p>
<p>The special cases of people dropping out are usually related to feeling too overwhelmed or not putting in enough effort. So, related to the previous point, pushing forwards to the end of the course makes everything fit into place afterward.</p>
<hr>
<h3>3. Completing the course doesn’t give you enough experienced to land a job</h3>
<p>While it’s true that graduates still have some big knowledge gaps, most of the practical skills required to work as a junior dev are learned. It just needs some time working to be assimilated.</p>
<p>Your employer will generally understand this and won’t give you mission-critical assignments in your first months as a developer.</p>
<p>Moreover, after graduating, you have all the dormant knowledge and all the potential to kick off your software career. Companies usually embrace this fact, since they see it as an investment opportunity to make you grow following their practices.</p>
<hr>
<h3>4. They’re just too expensive</h3>
<p>That’s a fact. Around 10k for three months.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the average yearly salary for a software dev in the US is ~76k, so it really is an investment in yourself.</p>
<hr>
<h3>5. It’s not comparable to Software Engineering in a University</h3>
<p>Usually, boot camps aren’t regulated as a traditional superior studies center, such as universities. So it’s not a “formal” title.</p>
<p>This point can scare off some people. However, in my experience, the number of potential employers that have asked me for a formal university title is <strong>none</strong>.</p>
<p>Companies don’t really care about titles, generally, they care about your skills and you being able to get your work done. And, for a software developer, that’s easily put under test with live coding interviews and take-home assignments.</p>
<hr>
<h3>6. There won’t be enough jobs soon</h3>
<p>While it’s true that there is a big demand for software developers right now, having boot camps put out in the market by dozens of juniors developers every month will make it more difficult to find a job soon.</p>
<p>However, I think this is still long from happening. At the moment, every company is a software company or requires software services of some kind, so demand is enormous.</p>
<p>Besides, graduating from the boot camp is only the first step, afterwards, you’ll keep on learning, specializing, and finding your niche. For me, it was just the first step in the tech business.</p>
<hr>
<h3>— In Short</h3>
<p>Before deciding to enroll in a software engineering boot camp, mind all the possible outcomes.</p>
<p><strong>If you put effort and interest, it’s absolutely doable</strong>. In my experience, one of the best decisions I made. However, every person is different.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[The story of my career change, and how first choices aren’t usually the best for your future]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="./images/hand.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<h2>The Beginning — My Old Job</h2>
<p>Barcelona, 2018.</p>
<p>I was working as a live audiovisual technician in events like shows and conferences. It was my first serious job that I landed after graduating of my Audiovisual Communications degree.</p>
<p>I didn’t quite like it because the working hours were terrible so I couldn’t really have a social life out of work. Moreover, the senior employees in the company didn’t seem very happy with their situation either.</p>
<p>So <strong>there wasn’t a nice future for me</strong> by doing that.</p>
<p>After a very intense project, I decided to quit the job. I didn’t have a plan B, I just knew I had to stop it cold turkey before finding something else— Impulses are my thing.</p>
<h2>The Search — A Better Future</h2>
<p>I was in my mid-twenties and the most logical step after my degree in Audiovisual Communications was to do some master’s degree.</p>
<p>After some research, it seemed like <strong>every master's degree cost around 10k</strong>. I thought it was a fair price if that was going to land me with a better-paying job, but <strong>the ratios of graduated to employed were pretty low</strong>. Besides, the skills they taught didn’t seem that useful and I wasn’t really interested in them.</p>
<h2>First Idea — Masters Degree in Digital Marketing</h2>
<p>In the end, as it seemed I had to pick something and I always was an Internet-friendly person, I picked a Masters's Degree in Digital Marketing.</p>
<p>However, before actually enrolling, I asked a friend who was working as a digital marketer at the time. In hindsight, that is the best thing I did in a long time.</p>
<p>She told me <strong>that was a really bad idea</strong> since she knew me and my profile was none as it was expected for the job. I’d have hated every moment of it.</p>
<h2>Second Idea — Software Engineering Bootcamp</h2>
<p>However, she gave me the idea to enroll in a Software Engineering boot camp. I didn’t really understand that, since <strong>I hadn’t any engineering or coding experience.</strong></p>
<p>She said that a person from her company did it and now was working as a developer and that I would probably be able to do it too. That was 3 intense months of study but, after that, <strong>it was easy to land a good-paying job</strong>.</p>
<h2>Choosing a Bootcamp</h2>
<p>I decided on the boot camp and started comparing. I was looking for something in the Barcelona area. There were many options but in the end, I boiled it down to two: <a href="https://www.ironhack.com/">Ironhack</a> or <a href="https://codeworks.me/">Codeworks</a>.</p>
<p>Both of them would <strong>take me around 3 months to complete</strong>, but Ironhack was substantially more economic. On the other hand, Codeworks seem to be much more in-depth. Also, despite being a 10k investment, <strong>their graduate-to-employee ratio was unbeatable</strong>. So I decided to pick Codeworks and booked an appointment for an intro interview.</p>
<h2>The Selection Process — Part 1. The test</h2>
<p>The process consisted of a one-hour coding test in the boot camp premises and a coding assignment to take home and complete in a week. After setting a date for the test, they pointed me to some free online resources about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to prepare for the test.</p>
<p>I learned an immensely high amount of concepts in a short time only by going through those online resources to prepare for the test. <strong>I hadn’t learned that much since university.</strong></p>
<p>On the day of the test, while I was getting to the office, I was very nervous. The test consisted of resolving a set of simple JavaScript algorithms in a computer next to an instructor. Despite being shaky, I did it correctly and passed the test.</p>
<h2>The Selection Process — Part 2. The assignment</h2>
<p>Now it was time for the take-home assignment. The instructor let me chose between 3 projects and I — completely dedicated to this new path — took the most difficult one: building a BlackJack game.</p>
<p>I was working on the assignment for the whole week. I became an expert in searching Google and Stack Overflow for problems that appeared in my code and, in the end, <strong>I achieved <a href="https://jportella93.github.io/Blackjack/index.html">a very decent BlackJack game</a> that impressed the reviewers</strong>.</p>
<h2>The Pre-Course</h2>
<p>After this, I paid a part of the tuition and received my pre-course resources, which consisted of 3 very complex exercises which I had to finish in order to get admitted to the boot camp.</p>
<p>These were <strong>really difficult</strong>. It touched very complex JavaScript concepts which many professional developers don’t really know. However, after 2 intense weeks, I finished them and was ready to start the course!</p>
<h2>The Course</h2>
<p>I started in the April batch. In my batch, there were 13 more people from around the world who also were aspiring Software Developers.</p>
<p><strong>Those were 3 intense months</strong>. We were on campus from Monday to Saturday, from 8.30 am to 9 pm. And sometimes we’d also go on Sunday to recover topics.</p>
<p>It was hands-down <strong>the most intense learning experience I had</strong>. We went in-depth over every topic related to working as a Software Developer. When we were about to master a concept, we were already starting with the next one. There was virtually no time to get bored, it was frenetic. The instructors <strong>were very good</strong> and helped us when we got stuck.</p>
<p>After the first half of the course learning and solidifying all the topics. There was the second half, where we build 3 web applications from the ground up. <strong>These proved invaluable for the job search</strong>. Finally, in the last part of the course, we spend some time focusing in how to get a good developer job and how to ace interviews.</p>
<h2>My Post-Bootcamp Job</h2>
<p>As soon as I finished the boot camp, my job became finding a job. I spent several hours a day going through LinkedIn and other job boards, contacting recruiters, and doing tests. I made a spreadsheet with all the companies I had applied to, the contact person, and the state of the selection process.</p>
<p><strong>Three weeks after graduating</strong>, after several interviews, I found a company that seemed really interesting, <a href="https://n1-headache.com/">Curelator N1-Headache</a>. Their mission is to help people suffering from migraine to control them by using an individualized analytical approach. I had a couple of meetings with the company and decided it was a good place to start my career as Software Developer, <strong>I got hired</strong>.</p>
<p>The best part was that <strong>I recovered my boot camp investment in 3 months.</strong></p>
<h2>Two Years Later</h2>
<p>I’m still in the same company, currently as a Front-End Engineer. <strong>I have an important role over most products in the company</strong>. Besides, I’ve learned a number of skills and keep doing so every day.</p>
<p>Also, one day a week, I’m <strong>forming new Software developers</strong> in the boot camp where I learned everything on this subject. Recently, <a href="https://www.switchup.org/rankings/best-coding-bootcamps">the boot camp raised to the top five best Software Engineering boot camps in the whole world</a>.</p>
<p>I usually work remotely. And <strong>both of my jobs haven’t been affected a bit by the COVID19 situation</strong>.</p>
<h2>Bottom Line</h2>
<p>When I see social media posts of my ex-coworkers complaining about how since the COVID19 crisis there are no jobs, I confirm that <strong>following my gut and leaving that company was the best decision ever.</strong></p>
<p>So don’t be afraid to reinvent yourself. <strong>If you fancy a change… go for it!</strong></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>These are custom made, they don’t appear in the Git docs! Saved me countless headaches in the last two years…</p>
<p><img src="/content/blog/5-remarkable-git-commands-that-will-boost-your-coding-productivity/images/0.png" alt=""></p>
<h3>1. Git Commit Work In Progess — gwip</h3>
<p>This command will stage all current changes and commit them with a default message.</p>
<p>It’s very useful for saving your current work and checking another branch and then coming back to it.</p>
<p>Also to save your current work for the day and push it to the remote, just in case your computer breaks until the next time you open the code. It adds a commit message such as <code>--wip-- [skip ci]</code> so your CI can be configured to skip this commit.</p>
<p>It comes with <a href="https://ohmyz.sh/">ohmyzsh</a> but can also be added manually by adding this line in <code>~/.bashrc</code></p>
<div class="remark-highlight"><pre class="language-shell"><code class="language-shell"><span class="token builtin class-name">alias</span> <span class="token assign-left variable">gwip</span><span class="token operator">=</span><span class="token string">'git add -A; git rm $(git ls-files --deleted) 2> /dev/null; git commit --no-verify --no-gpg-sign -m "--wip-- [skip ci]"'</span>
</code></pre></div>
<hr>
<h3>2. Git Uncommit Work In Progess — gunwip 🔫</h3>
<p>It’s the twin of #1 <code>gwip</code> .It resets the last commit created by <code>gwip</code> leaving your work in the state it was before running <code>gwip</code>.</p>
<p>It also comes with <a href="https://ohmyz.sh/">ohmyzsh</a> but can also be added manually by adding this line in <code>~/.bashrc</code></p>
<div class="remark-highlight"><pre class="language-shell"><code class="language-shell"><span class="token builtin class-name">alias</span> <span class="token assign-left variable">gunwip</span><span class="token operator">=</span><span class="token string">'git log -n 1 | grep -q -c "\-\-wip\-\-" &#x26;&#x26; git reset HEAD~1'</span>
</code></pre></div>
<hr>
<h3>3. Git Stash Staged — gsts</h3>
<p>You are trying to find a bug in your current set of changed files but you are not sure which file causes it.</p>
<p>A good approach for debugging this could be stashing files that might cause it (so they would temporarily be back to their state in the previous commit) and check if the bug is still there.</p>
<p>Use the <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/editor/versioncontrol#_git-support">VSCode source control tab</a> (or the CLI) to see which files have changes and stage the ones you think could be causing the bug. Then run this command and check if the bug is still there. If the bug is still there, go back to the previous state by running <code>git stash pop</code> and try again with other files.</p>
<p>Use this command by adding this line in <code>~/.bashrc</code></p>
<div class="remark-highlight"><pre class="language-shell"><code class="language-shell"><span class="token builtin class-name">alias</span> <span class="token assign-left variable">gsts</span><span class="token operator">=</span><span class="token string">'git stash -- $(git diff --staged --name-only)'</span>
</code></pre></div>
<hr>
<h3>4. Git Move — gmove</h3>
<p>You are working in a feature when you happen to discover a bug completely unrelated to the feature. You can easily fix this bug. What do you do?</p>
<p>You have two options:</p>
<ol>
<li>Fixing the bug and adding a commit in the feature branch. This is a bad idea since it mixes two unrelated things in the branch. What if the feature is reverted or never released? The bug would reappear.</li>
<li>Adding a ticket for the bug and sending it to the backlog. That would be a good idea if the bug could potentially take a long time to fix. But <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done">as David Allen says in Getting Things Done</a>, “If you can do it in less than two minutes, do it now”. So what do you do?</li>
</ol>
<h4><strong>Solution: gmove</strong></h4>
<p>You fix the bug, stage only the changes related to the bug and execute</p>
<div class="remark-highlight"><pre class="language-shell"><code class="language-shell">gmove bugfix master
</code></pre></div>
<p>This will create a branch called <code>bugfix</code> based off <code>master</code> with only the bug fix.</p>
<p>This way you can quickly separate concerns between your branches and also make reviewers happy!</p>
<p>You can have this command by adding this lines to <code>~/.bashrc</code></p>
<div class="remark-highlight"><pre class="language-shell"><code class="language-shell"><span class="token function-name function">gmove</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>
  <span class="token function">git</span> stash -- <span class="token variable"><span class="token variable">$(</span><span class="token function">git</span> <span class="token function">diff</span> <span class="token parameter variable">--staged</span> --name-only<span class="token variable">)</span></span> <span class="token operator">&#x26;&#x26;</span>
  gwip <span class="token punctuation">;</span>
  <span class="token function">git</span> branch <span class="token variable">$1</span> <span class="token variable">$2</span> <span class="token operator">&#x26;&#x26;</span>
  <span class="token function">git</span> checkout <span class="token variable">$1</span> <span class="token operator">&#x26;&#x26;</span>
  <span class="token function">git</span> stash pop
<span class="token punctuation">}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Note that this command is depending on command #1 <code>gwip</code> on this page. Also, when coming back to your branch, you can use command #2 <code>gunwip </code>to reset your working state.</p>
<hr>
<h3>5. BONUS: Git Push Origin Head</h3>
<p>Did you ever do <code>git push</code> and had git yell to you this?</p>
<div class="remark-highlight"><pre class="language-shell"><code class="language-shell">fatal: The current branch <span class="token builtin class-name">test</span> has no upstream branch.To push the current branch and <span class="token builtin class-name">set</span> the remote as upstream, use

<span class="token function">git</span> push --set-upstream origin my-branch
</code></pre></div>
<p>Avoiding this is as easy as setting this two aliases in <code>~/.bashrc</code></p>
<div class="remark-highlight"><pre class="language-shell"><code class="language-shell"><span class="token builtin class-name">alias</span> <span class="token assign-left variable">gpsh</span><span class="token operator">=</span><span class="token string">"git push origin HEAD"</span>
</code></pre></div>
<div class="remark-highlight"><pre class="language-shell"><code class="language-shell"><span class="token builtin class-name">alias</span> <span class="token assign-left variable">gpshf</span><span class="token operator">=</span><span class="token string">"git push -f origin HEAD"</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>This will automatically push your branch to a branch with the same name on the remote, or create it if it doesn’t exist.</p>

<h3>1. Update your NPM modules with one command</h3>
<p>One common source of confusion for new Node.js developers is the command <code>npm update</code>. It will update all <code>node_modules</code> present in <code>package.json</code> to their latest versions but <strong>it will not change the version names</strong> in <code>package.json</code>.</p>
<p>So PROBLEM: when another developer clones your repo and runs <code>npm install</code>, they will get an older version from the <code>node_modules</code> than you.</p>
<p>I found an automatic solution for this: the package <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-check-updates">npm-check-updates</a>. Let’s see how it works:</p>
<div class="remark-highlight"><pre class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash">npx npm-check-updates
</code></pre></div>
<p>The output of this command will show which packages have a newer available version.</p>
<p>But the real fun is in calling it with the flag <code>-u</code>, which <strong>will actually update your package.json with the latest versions</strong>. Then just run <code>npm install</code> and all your <code>node_modules</code> will be updated.</p>
<p>And, as the <code>package.json</code> has been updated, every other developer that runs <code>npm install</code> will get the same updated versions. Success!</p>

<h3>2. Specify a React.js Component as PropType</h3>
<p>With component composition, this can be a common pattern (modified from the <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/composition-vs-inheritance.html#containment">React.js docs</a>):</p>
<div class="remark-highlight"><pre class="language-jsx"><code class="language-jsx"><span class="token comment">// Create a layout component, that render children on slots.</span>
<span class="token keyword">const</span> <span class="token function-variable function"><span class="token maybe-class-name">SplitPane</span></span> <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token parameter"><span class="token punctuation">{</span> leftComponent<span class="token punctuation">,</span> rightComponent <span class="token punctuation">}</span></span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token arrow operator">=></span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span>
  <span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&#x3C;</span>div</span> <span class="token attr-name">className</span><span class="token attr-value"><span class="token punctuation attr-equals">=</span><span class="token punctuation">"</span>SplitPane<span class="token punctuation">"</span></span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span><span class="token plain-text"></span>
<span class="token plain-text">    </span><span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&#x3C;</span>div</span> <span class="token attr-name">className</span><span class="token attr-value"><span class="token punctuation attr-equals">=</span><span class="token punctuation">"</span>SplitPane-left<span class="token punctuation">"</span></span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span><span class="token punctuation">{</span>leftComponent<span class="token punctuation">}</span><span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&#x3C;/</span>div</span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span><span class="token plain-text"></span>
<span class="token plain-text">    </span><span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&#x3C;</span>div</span> <span class="token attr-name">className</span><span class="token attr-value"><span class="token punctuation attr-equals">=</span><span class="token punctuation">"</span>SplitPane-right<span class="token punctuation">"</span></span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span><span class="token punctuation">{</span>rightComponent<span class="token punctuation">}</span><span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&#x3C;/</span>div</span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span><span class="token plain-text"></span>
<span class="token plain-text">  </span><span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&#x3C;/</span>div</span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span>
<span class="token punctuation">)</span>

<span class="token keyword">const</span> <span class="token function-variable function"><span class="token maybe-class-name">App</span></span> <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token arrow operator">=></span> <span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&#x3C;</span><span class="token class-name">SplitPane</span></span> <span class="token attr-name">left</span><span class="token script language-javascript"><span class="token script-punctuation punctuation">=</span><span class="token punctuation">{</span><span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&#x3C;</span><span class="token class-name">Contacts</span></span> <span class="token punctuation">/></span></span><span class="token punctuation">}</span></span> <span class="token attr-name">right</span><span class="token script language-javascript"><span class="token script-punctuation punctuation">=</span><span class="token punctuation">{</span><span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&#x3C;</span><span class="token class-name">Chat</span></span> <span class="token punctuation">/></span></span><span class="token punctuation">}</span></span> <span class="token punctuation">/></span></span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>**But how can you specify a component or a rendered value as a PropType?**From the <a href="https://github.com/facebook/prop-types#usage">PropTypes docs</a>:</p>
<div class="remark-highlight"><pre class="language-js"><code class="language-js"><span class="token comment">// Anything that can be rendered: numbers, strings, elements or an array</span>
  <span class="token comment">// (or fragment) containing these types.</span>
  <span class="token literal-property property">optionalNode</span><span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token maybe-class-name">PropTypes</span><span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token property-access">node</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span>

  <span class="token comment">// A React element (ie. &#x3C;MyComponent />).</span>
  <span class="token literal-property property">optionalElement</span><span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token maybe-class-name">PropTypes</span><span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token property-access">element</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>So we could modify SplitPane like:</p>
<div class="remark-highlight"><pre class="language-jsx"><code class="language-jsx"><span class="token keyword">const</span> <span class="token function-variable function"><span class="token maybe-class-name">SplitPane</span></span> <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token parameter"><span class="token punctuation">{</span> leftComponent<span class="token punctuation">,</span> rightComponent <span class="token punctuation">}</span></span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token arrow operator">=></span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span>

<h3>3. Clean-Up local Git branches</h3>
<p>To delete all local branches except <code>master</code> and <code>feat/something-neat</code>:</p>
<div class="remark-highlight"><pre class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token function">git</span> branch <span class="token operator">|</span> <span class="token function">egrep</span> <span class="token parameter variable">-v</span> <span class="token string">'master|feat/something-neat'</span> <span class="token operator">|</span> <span class="token function">xargs</span> <span class="token function">git</span> branch <span class="token parameter variable">-D</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Let’s break it down:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>git branch</code> shows all your local branches, this gets piped to <code>egrep</code></li>
<li><code>egrep</code> will return every branch that matches any identifier inside the quotes, which are separated by a <code>|</code>. The flag <code>-v</code> makes it return every branch that does <strong>not</strong> match the identifiers. This gets piped to <code>xargs</code></li>
<li><code>xargs</code> passes branch names as arguments to <code>git branch -D</code>, which deletes the branch</li>
</ol>
<p>It’s a good idea to first run <code>git branch | egrep -v 'master|feat/something-neat'</code> to see which branches will be deleted, and then run the full command.</p>
<hr>
<h3>4. Get a professional git history</h3>
<p>Let’s say we are starting a website. We have 3 commits:</p>
<div class="remark-highlight"><pre class="language-shell"><code class="language-shell">747ef1e feat: <span class="token function">add</span> Button
19d9327 feat: <span class="token function">add</span> Navbar
effb3b4 initial commit
</code></pre></div>
<p>But then we realise that we forget to commits some changes on the Navbar commit. What do we do? We could make a new commit with a message like <code>git commit -m 'fix: missing changes on Navbar'</code>, but that commit wouldn’t have any semantic value to the commit history and it’d only make it less clear.</p>
<p>A proper solution would be to <strong>fixup</strong> the commit. We would do <code>git commit --fixup 19d9327</code>. Our history would be like this now:</p>
<div class="remark-highlight"><pre class="language-shell"><code class="language-shell">c2149d1 fixup<span class="token operator">!</span> feat: <span class="token function">add</span> Navbar
747ef1e feat: <span class="token function">add</span> Button
19d9327 feat: <span class="token function">add</span> Navbar
effb3b4 initial commit
</code></pre></div>
<p>And now, to squash this last commit with its reference, we would do <code>git rebase --autosquash --interactive effb3b4</code>. This will open Vim or other terminal text editor, just save the changes pressing <code>ZZ</code> and your history now will look like this:</p>
<div class="remark-highlight"><pre class="language-shell"><code class="language-shell">de1e9de feat: <span class="token function">add</span> Button
b3b4932 feat: <span class="token function">add</span> Navbar
effb3b4 initial commit
</code></pre></div>
<p>Note that the commit hashes have changed, so only do this with commits that hasn’t been pushed yet.</p>
<p>Thanks to <a href="https://blog.sebastian-daschner.com/entries/git-commit-fixup-autosquash">Sebastian Daschner</a> for this knowledge!</p>

<h3>5. Quickly start your work environment (MacOS)</h3>
<p>There are a number of apps and programs that I use while working. Opening them one by one at the start of the day is a hassle and so is closing them at the end. So I made a bash script to automate this. Copy this text in <code>~/.bashrc</code> .</p>
<p>For opening everything:</p>
<div class="remark-highlight"><pre class="language-shell"><code class="language-shell"><span class="token builtin class-name">alias</span> <span class="token assign-left variable">work_on</span><span class="token operator">=</span><span class="token string">"</span>
<span class="token string">open /Applications/Slack.app ; /</span>
<span class="token string">open /Applications/Mail.app ; /</span>
<span class="token string">open /Applications/Zeplin.app ; /</span>
<span class="token string">open /Applications/Postman.app ; /</span>
<span class="token string">"</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Now I can just open my computer’s Terminal and type <code>work_on</code>and everything will be ready. Basically, you are passing the location of the app to the command <code>open</code> and concatenating the commands with <code>;</code>. Most of the apps live in <code>/Applications</code></p>
<p>For closing everything:</p>
<div class="remark-highlight"><pre class="language-shell"><code class="language-shell"><span class="token builtin class-name">alias</span> <span class="token assign-left variable">work_off</span><span class="token operator">=</span><span class="token string">"
osascript -e 'quit app <span title="\&#x22;" class="token entity">\"</span>Zeplin<span title="\&#x22;" class="token entity">\"</span>' ; /
osascript -e 'quit app <span title="\&#x22;" class="token entity">\"</span>Mail<span title="\&#x22;" class="token entity">\"</span>' ; /
osascript -e 'quit app <span title="\&#x22;" class="token entity">\"</span>Code<span title="\&#x22;" class="token entity">\"</span>' ; /
osascript -e 'quit app <span title="\&#x22;" class="token entity">\"</span>Slack<span title="\&#x22;" class="token entity">\"</span>' ; /
osascript -e 'quit app <span title="\&#x22;" class="token entity">\"</span>Postman<span title="\&#x22;" class="token entity">\"</span>' ; /
"</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>To close apps on macOS we can execute the <code>quit app</code> command with <code>osascript -e</code>.</p>
<p>Note here that I’m also closing my text editor <code>osascript -e 'quit app \"Code\"'</code> but I’m not opening it in the previous command. This is because I have a custom alias to open the editor with every different repo, so each time it will be different on opening but it will be the same on closing.</p>
<hr>
<h3>BONUS: How to be polite with your shell</h3>
<p>This is more like an easter egg but in <code>~/.bashrc</code> set de following alias:</p>
<div class="remark-highlight"><pre class="language-shell"><code class="language-shell"><span class="token builtin class-name">alias</span> <span class="token assign-left variable">please</span><span class="token operator">=</span><span class="token string">"sudo"</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>So now you can run polite super user commands:</p>
<div class="remark-highlight"><pre class="language-shell"><code class="language-shell">please gatsby develop
</code></pre></div>

<p>As the last test in order to get admitted in <a href="https://codeworks.me/">Codeworks</a>, the full stack JavaScript bootcamp I did back in 2018, I had one week to create and deliver a blackjack game.</p>
<p>I had some much fun doing it and though I might link it here, just in case someone wants to play :)</p>
<p>This is <a href="https://github.com/jportella93/Blackjack">the GitHub repo</a> and the game can be played <a href="https://jportella93.github.io/Blackjack/index.html">here</a>.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[Never trust the design.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="./images/road-loor-nicolas.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>So imagine you have a component that shows some user information like name, surname and e-mail. The design shows a nice layout where all lines take the same space.</p>
<p><img src="./images/example1.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Easy enough, you implement the design and release it into the wild. But then you realize that this UI can break with a person with a longer name.</p>
<p><img src="./images/example2.png" alt=""></p>
<p>That's because the data being shown has <strong>variable length</strong> and you should account for all the cases where it will be used. <a href="/displaying-data-with-variable-length-example#example-1" target="_blank">Here is a demo with the example.</a></p>
<p>There will be users with super long names, e-mail addresses and what not and this shouldn't break your UI. One approach to prevent this would be to create a wrapper component for variable length text which is expected to be shown in a single line. All overflowing text can be scrolled to the side if needed.</p>
<div class="remark-highlight"><pre class="language-jsx"><code class="language-jsx"><span class="token keyword">const</span> oneLineScrollerStyle <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>
  <span class="token literal-property property">overflow</span><span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token string">'hidden'</span> <span class="token comment">// Avoid breaking UI</span>
<span class="token punctuation">}</span>

<span class="token keyword">const</span> oneLineScrollerChildrenWrapperStyle <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>
  <span class="token literal-property property">whiteSpace</span><span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token string">'nowrap'</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token comment">// Render text in one line</span>
  <span class="token literal-property property">display</span><span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token string">'block'</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span>
  <span class="token literal-property property">overflow</span><span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token string">'auto'</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token comment">// Scroll overflow if needed</span>
<span class="token punctuation">}</span>

  <span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&#x3C;</span>span</span> <span class="token attr-name">style</span><span class="token script language-javascript"><span class="token script-punctuation punctuation">=</span><span class="token punctuation">{</span>oneLineScrollerStyle<span class="token punctuation">}</span></span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span><span class="token plain-text"></span>
<span class="token plain-text">    </span><span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&#x3C;</span>span</span> <span class="token attr-name">style</span><span class="token script language-javascript"><span class="token script-punctuation punctuation">=</span><span class="token punctuation">{</span>oneLineScrollerChildrenWrapperStyle<span class="token punctuation">}</span></span><span class="token punctuation">></span></span><span class="token plain-text"></span>

<span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Wrapping your text fields with this component makes them span exactly one line. <a href="/displaying-data-with-variable-length-example#example-2">Example #2 has the OneLineScroller</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="./images/6-loor-nicolas.jpg" alt=""></p>
<h2>1. How to properly update your Node.js modules to the latest versions</h2>
<p>One common source of confusion for new Node.js developers is the command <code>npm update</code>. It will update all <code>node_modules</code> present in <code>package.json</code> to their latest versions but <strong>it will not change the version names</strong> in <code>package.json</code>.</p>
<p>So PROBLEM: when another developer clones your repo and runs <code>npm install</code>, she will get an older version from the <code>node_modules</code> than you.</p>
<p>I found an automatic solution for this: the package <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-check-updates">npm-check-updates</a>. Let's see how it works:</p>
<div class="remark-highlight"><pre class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash">$ <span class="token function">npm</span> <span class="token function">install</span> –g npm-check-updates
</code></pre></div>
<p>Once installed globally, you can call it like this:</p>
<div class="remark-highlight"><pre class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash">$ ncu
</code></pre></div>
<p>The output of this command will show which packages have a newer available version.</p>
<p>But the real fun is in calling it with the flag <code>-u</code>, which <strong>will actually update your package.json with the latest versions</strong>. Then just run <code>npm install</code> and all your <code>node_modules</code> will be updated.</p>
<p>And, as the <code>package.json</code> has been updated, every other developer that runs <code>npm install</code> will get the same updated versions. Success!</p>
<h2>2. How to build a rich text editor in React.js</h2>
<p>So I had to build a text editor for a <code>React.js</code> application, with bold, underline, italics, indentation, text aligning, bulletpoints and table functionality. After researching some libraries I found one that was super flexible and had an overall great developer experience: <a href="https://www.slatejs.org/#/rich-text">Slate.js</a>. 100% would recommend.</p>
<h2>3. How to properly handle browser events</h2>
<p>While working on a web page with lots of animations triggered by window size, I realized that working with <code>addEventListener</code> and <code>removeEventListener</code> is difficult, because they require the exact same event handler. <a href="/you-are-using-browser-events-wrong">I wrote a small post explaining my approach</a>.</p>
<h2>4. How to specify a React.js Component as PropType</h2>
<p>With component composition, this can be a common pattern (modified from the <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/composition-vs-inheritance.html#containment">React.js docs</a>):</p>

<p><strong>But how can you specify a component or a rendered value as a PropType?</strong></p>
<p>From the <a href="https://github.com/facebook/prop-types#usage">PropTypes docs</a>:</p>
<div class="remark-highlight"><pre class="language-javascript"><code class="language-javascript"><span class="token comment">// Anything that can be rendered: numbers, strings, elements or an array</span>
  <span class="token comment">// (or fragment) containing these types.</span>
  <span class="token literal-property property">optionalNode</span><span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token maybe-class-name">PropTypes</span><span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token property-access">node</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span>

  <span class="token comment">// A React element (ie. &#x3C;MyComponent />).</span>
  <span class="token literal-property property">optionalElement</span><span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token maybe-class-name">PropTypes</span><span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token property-access">element</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span>

<h2>5. How to build a data-grid table in React.js</h2>
<p>Ok, building a table doesn't sound like anything difficult, right? just use a <code>&#x3C;table></code> element and it's sub-elements.</p>
<p>But what happens when you want display some data with filtering, all kinds of sorting, custom renderers for each cell...?</p>
<p>I found myself in this situation and ended up using the batteries-included <a href="https://github.com/tannerlinsley/react-table">react-table package</a>. It really has a ton of out-of-the-box functionality and a great <a href="https://github.com/tannerlinsley/react-table/tree/v6#codesandbox-examples">set of examples</a> to get you up and running quickly!</p>
<p>I also would recommend it 100%.</p>
<h2>6. How to be polite with your shell</h2>
<p>This is more like an easter egg but in <code>~/.bashrc</code> set de following alias:</p>
<div class="remark-highlight"><pre class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token builtin class-name">alias</span> <span class="token assign-left variable">please</span><span class="token operator">=</span><span class="token string">"sudo"</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>So now you can run polite command like:</p>
<div class="remark-highlight"><pre class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash">$ please gatsby develop
</code></pre></div>

<p>Will this code work?</p>
<div class="remark-highlight"><pre class="language-javascript"><code class="language-javascript"><span class="token comment">// Listen to scroll event to log 'Scrolling!' to console.</span>

</code></pre></div>
<p>Open your browser JavaScript console right now and paste this code.</p>
<p>What happens? The window keeps listening for the scroll event.</p>
<p>The problem here is that to <strong>remove the event listener you have to pass the same handler</strong> that you passed to <code>addEventListener</code> to <code>removeEventListener</code>. But passing an anonymous function, even if the content is the same, is always a different handler, so it doesn't remove the event.</p>
<p>So in this case, to remove your event listener you could do something like:</p>
<div class="remark-highlight"><pre class="language-javascript"><code class="language-javascript"><span class="token comment">// Same function will be passed to add/removeEventListener.</span>
<span class="token keyword">function</span> <span class="token function">logScroll</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>
  <span class="token console class-name">console</span><span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token method function property-access">log</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">"Scrolling!"</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
<span class="token punctuation">}</span>

<span class="token comment">// Listen to scroll to log 'Scrolling!' to console.</span>
<span class="token dom variable">window</span><span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token method function property-access">addEventListener</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">"scroll"</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> logScroll<span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token boolean">false</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>

<span class="token comment">// After 1 second, stop listening to scroll to stop logging 'Scrolling!' to console.</span>
<span class="token dom variable">window</span><span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token method function property-access">setTimeout</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>
  <span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token arrow operator">=></span> <span class="token dom variable">window</span><span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token method function property-access">removeEventListener</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">"scroll"</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> logScroll<span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token boolean">false</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span>
  <span class="token number">1000</span>
<span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Now, this works. But what will happen when you have many diferent events, with different handlers, which are being enabled and disabled at different moments? how can you keep track of all this?</p>
<p>We are going to create a store for our event handlers.</p>
<div class="remark-highlight"><pre class="language-javascript"><code class="language-javascript"><span class="token keyword">class</span> <span class="token class-name">EventHandlerStore</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>

            <description><![CDATA[This time tips and tricks on CSS Modules, a lot of BASH and GIT stuff, macOS apps, using searchable components and fighting Chrome's autocomplete styling.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="./images/9-loor-nicolas.jpg" alt=""></p>
<h2>1. How to use CSS Modules in create-react-app.</h2>
<p>With CSS Modules you can make CSS classes with a component scope. This allows to use simple class names and avoid name collisions between components. Following the <a href="https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/adding-a-css-modules-stylesheet">Create React App docs</a>:</p>
<div class="remark-highlight"><pre class="language-CSS"><code class="language-CSS">/* Button.module.css */
.error {
  background-color: red;
}</code></pre></div>
<div class="remark-highlight"><pre class="language-CSS"><code class="language-CSS">/* another-stylesheet.css */
.error {
  background-color: blue;
}</code></pre></div>
<div class="remark-highlight"><pre class="language-javascript"><code class="language-javascript"><span class="token comment">// Button.js</span>
<span class="token keyword module">import</span> <span class="token imports"><span class="token maybe-class-name">React</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span> <span class="token maybe-class-name">Component</span> <span class="token punctuation">}</span></span> <span class="token keyword module">from</span> <span class="token string">'react'</span>
<span class="token keyword module">import</span> <span class="token imports">styles</span> <span class="token keyword module">from</span> <span class="token string">'./Button.module.css'</span> <span class="token comment">// Import css modules stylesheet as styles</span>
<span class="token keyword module">import</span> <span class="token string">'./another-stylesheet.css'</span> <span class="token comment">// Import regular stylesheet</span>

<span class="token keyword">class</span> <span class="token class-name">Button</span> <span class="token keyword">extends</span> <span class="token class-name">Component</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>
  <span class="token function">render</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>
    <span class="token comment">// reference as a js object</span>
    <span class="token keyword control-flow">return</span> <span class="token operator">&#x3C;</span>button className<span class="token operator">=</span><span class="token punctuation">{</span>styles<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token property-access">error</span><span class="token punctuation">}</span><span class="token operator">></span><span class="token known-class-name class-name">Error</span> <span class="token maybe-class-name">Button</span><span class="token operator">&#x3C;</span><span class="token operator">/</span>button<span class="token operator">></span> <span class="token comment">// Background color will be red</span>
  <span class="token punctuation">}</span>
<span class="token punctuation">}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>To achieve this, you just need to change the file name of the stylesheet from <code>Button.css</code> to <code>Button.module.css</code>. At compile time, the class name will be replaced by a unique class name following the format <code>[filename]\_[classname]\_\_[hash]</code>.</p>
<h2>2. How to cleanup local Git branches</h2>
<p>To delete all local branches except <code>master</code> and <code>feat/something-neat</code>:</p>
<div class="remark-highlight"><pre class="language-shell"><code class="language-shell">$ <span class="token function">git</span> branch <span class="token operator">|</span> <span class="token function">egrep</span> <span class="token parameter variable">-v</span> <span class="token string">'master|feat/something-neat'</span> <span class="token operator">|</span> <span class="token function">xargs</span> <span class="token function">git</span> branch <span class="token parameter variable">-D</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Let's break it down:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>git branch</code> shows all your local branches, this gets piped to <code>egrep</code></li>
<li><code>egrep</code> will return every branch that matches any identifier inside the quotes, which are separated by a <code>|</code>. The flag <code>-v</code> makes it return every branch that does <strong>not</strong> match the identifiers. This gets piped to <code>xargs</code></li>
<li><code>xargs</code> passes branch names as arguments to <code>git branch -D</code>, which deletes the branch</li>
</ol>
<p>It's a good idea to first run <code>git branch | egrep -v 'master|feat/something-neat'</code> to see which branches will be deleted, and then run the full command.</p>
<p>Read more about <code>xargs</code> <a href="https://shapeshed.com/unix-xargs/">here</a>.</p>
<h2>3. How to build searchable components using Fuse.js.</h2>
<p>I had to create a search component which included an input field. Typing on the input had to reveal fuzzy searches from a JSON file on another component.</p>
<p>This nice little package called <a href="https://fusejs.io/">Fuse.js</a> made it a breeze. it has a handful of custom options and parameters, such as fuzzynes/exactitude of the match, max number of items or priorititary items. Definitely worth checking it out!</p>
<h2>4. How to fight and plug into Chrome autocomplete feature.</h2>
<p>There's a <a href="http://webagility.com/posts/the-ultimate-list-of-hacks-for-chromes-forced-yellow-background-on-autocompleted-inputs">long list of hacks</a> to fight Chrome input field autocomplete styling. However, my problem was that I had to execute some JavaScript when this action triggered. But Chrome just adds a class to the autocompleted element, it doesn't trigger any event when autocompletes, so I didn't know how to detect it without polling.</p>
<p>After some research, I finally found a smart hack to plug into this event: It turns out you can listen for CSS animations events. So the trick is adding an empty CSS animation to the Chrome autocomplete class and listen for an animation start event with a JavaScript event listener. Then use it as a hook for whatever you need it. Really smart!</p>
<h2>5. How to git ignore momentarily.</h2>
<p>There are some files that should be always ignored by Git, that's why we include them in <code>.gitignore</code>. But what if you want to ignore a file just for a while? This happened to me with a compiled file created automatically by a task runner.</p>
<p>To ignore:</p>
<div class="remark-highlight"><pre class="language-shell"><code class="language-shell">$ <span class="token function">git</span> update-index --assume-unchanged <span class="token string">"src/ignore.js"</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>To stop ignoring:</p>
<div class="remark-highlight"><pre class="language-shell"><code class="language-shell">$ <span class="token function">git</span> update-index --no-assume-unchanged <span class="token string">"src/ignore.js"</span>
</code></pre></div>
<h2>6. How to make MacOS Spotlight suck less.</h2>
<p>Honestly, forget about Spotlight and try <a href="https://www.alfredapp.com/">Alfred</a>. Not only has a myriad customizations but also, and this was the deal breaker for me, it appears instantly when pressing the key.</p>
<p>Because waiting ~400ms for Spotlight to appear when pressing the key is just too much.</p>
<p>We are busy people, Apple!!</p>
<h2>7. How to reorder and fixup local git commits.</h2>
<p>Let's say we are starting a website. We have 3 commits:</p>
<div class="remark-highlight"><pre class="language-shell"><code class="language-shell">747ef1e feat: <span class="token function">add</span> Button
19d9327 feat: <span class="token function">add</span> Navbar
effb3b4 initial commit
</code></pre></div>
<p>But then we realise that we forget to commits some changes on the Navbar commit. What do we do?
We could make a new commit with a message like <code>git commit -m 'fix: missing changes on Navbar'</code>, but that commit wouldn't have any semantic value to the commit history and it'd only make it less clear.</p>
<p>A proper solution would be to <strong>fixup</strong> the commit. We would do <code>git commit --fixup 19d9327</code>. Our history would be like this now:</p>
<div class="remark-highlight"><pre class="language-shell"><code class="language-shell">c2149d1 fixup<span class="token operator">!</span> feat: <span class="token function">add</span> Navbar
747ef1e feat: <span class="token function">add</span> Button
19d9327 feat: <span class="token function">add</span> Navbar
effb3b4 initial commit
</code></pre></div>
<p>And now, to squash this last commit with its reference, we would do <code>git rebase --autosquash --interactive effb3b4</code>. This will open Vim or other terminal text editor, just save the changes pressing <code>ZZ</code> and your history now will look like this:</p>
<div class="remark-highlight"><pre class="language-shell"><code class="language-shell">de1e9de feat: <span class="token function">add</span> Button
b3b4932 feat: <span class="token function">add</span> Navbar
effb3b4 initial commit
</code></pre></div>
<p>Note that the commith hashes have changed, so only do this with commits that hasn't been pushed yet.</p>
<p>Thanks to <a href="https://blog.sebastian-daschner.com/entries/git-commit-fixup-autosquash">Sebastian Daschner</a> for this knowledge!</p>
<h2>8. How to concatenate commands in BASH</h2>
<p>Using the <code>;</code> operator, the second command will run after the first command.</p>
<div class="remark-highlight"><pre class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash">$ <span class="token function">cat</span> non_existing.txt <span class="token punctuation">;</span> <span class="token builtin class-name">echo</span> <span class="token string">'success!'</span>
-<span class="token operator">></span> cat: nonexisting.txt: No such <span class="token function">file</span> or directory
-<span class="token operator">></span> success<span class="token operator">!</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Using the <code>&#x26;&#x26;</code> operator, the second command will run <strong>only</strong> if the first command succeeds.</p>
<div class="remark-highlight"><pre class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash">$ <span class="token function">cat</span> non_existing.txt <span class="token operator">&#x26;&#x26;</span> <span class="token builtin class-name">echo</span> <span class="token string">'success!'</span>
-<span class="token operator">></span> cat: nonexisting.txt: No such <span class="token function">file</span> or directory
</code></pre></div>
<p>Using the <code>\</code> operator, you can split your command in multiple lines for readability.</p>
<div class="remark-highlight"><pre class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash">$ <span class="token builtin class-name">echo</span> <span class="token punctuation">\</span>
$ hello world
-<span class="token operator">></span> hello world
</code></pre></div>
<h2>9. How to quickly start my work environment</h2>
<p>There are a number of apps and programs that I use while working. Opening them one by one at the start of the day is a hassle and so is closing them at the end. So I made a bash script to automate this:</p>
<p>For opening everything:</p>
<div class="remark-highlight"><pre class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token comment"># in .bashrc</span>
<span class="token builtin class-name">alias</span> <span class="token assign-left variable">work_on</span><span class="token operator">=</span><span class="token string">"</span>
<span class="token string">open /Applications/Slack.app ; /</span>
<span class="token string">open /Applications/Mail.app ; /</span>
<span class="token string">open /Applications/Zeplin.app ; /</span>
<span class="token string">open /Applications/Postman.app ; /</span>
<span class="token string">open /Users/jon/Applications/Chrome\ Apps.localized/StackEdit.app ; /</span>
<span class="token string">vmon</span>
<span class="token string">"</span>

<span class="token comment"># in the CLI</span>
$ work_on
</code></pre></div>
<p>Basically, you are passing the location of the app to the command <code>open</code> and concatenating the commands with <code>;</code>. Most of the apps live in <code>/Applications</code> but for example StackEdit, which is a Chrome App, lives in <code>/Users/jon/Applications/Chrome\ Apps.localized</code></p>
<p>The last one <code>vmon</code> is a custom alias for starting my virtual machine.</p>
<p>For closing everything:</p>
<div class="remark-highlight"><pre class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token comment"># in .bashrc</span>
<span class="token builtin class-name">alias</span> <span class="token assign-left variable">work_off</span><span class="token operator">=</span><span class="token string">"
osascript -e 'quit app <span title="\&#x22;" class="token entity">\"</span>Zeplin<span title="\&#x22;" class="token entity">\"</span>' ; /
osascript -e 'quit app <span title="\&#x22;" class="token entity">\"</span>Mail<span title="\&#x22;" class="token entity">\"</span>' ; /
osascript -e 'quit app <span title="\&#x22;" class="token entity">\"</span>Code<span title="\&#x22;" class="token entity">\"</span>' ; /
osascript -e 'quit app <span title="\&#x22;" class="token entity">\"</span>Slack<span title="\&#x22;" class="token entity">\"</span>' ; /
osascript -e 'quit app <span title="\&#x22;" class="token entity">\"</span>Postman<span title="\&#x22;" class="token entity">\"</span>' ; /
osascript -e 'quit app <span title="\&#x22;" class="token entity">\"</span>StackEdit<span title="\&#x22;" class="token entity">\"</span>' ; /
vmoff
"</span>

<span class="token comment"># in the CLI</span>
$ work_off
</code></pre></div>
<p>To close apps on macOS we can execute the <code>quit app</code> command with <code>osascript -e</code>.</p>
<p>Note here that I'm also closing my text editor <code>osascript -e 'quit app \"Code\"'</code> but I'm not opening it in the previous command. This is because I have a custom alias to open the editor with every diferent repo, so each time it will be different on opening but it will be the same on closing.</p>
<p>Again, the last one <code>vmoff</code> is a custom alias for stopping my virtual machine.</p>

<h2>1. How to count occurrences of a data cell in a .cvs (Python and Pandas).</h2>
<p>I had a big .cvs file with a log of e-mails sent. The columns included e-mail address, timestamp, state, subject, etc. All mails were using some template from a set of 10 or so templates.</p>
<p>At some point I wanted to know how many mails were sent with the same template. So I ended up with this code:</p>
<div class="remark-highlight"><pre class="language-python"><code class="language-python"><span class="token keyword">import</span> sys
<span class="token keyword">import</span> pandas <span class="token keyword">as</span> pd

pd<span class="token punctuation">.</span>set_option<span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">'display.max_colwidth'</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token operator">-</span><span class="token number">1</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span>

<span class="token comment"># csv file is passed as first argument on the command line</span>

df <span class="token operator">=</span> pd<span class="token punctuation">.</span>read_csv<span class="token punctuation">(</span>csv_file<span class="token punctuation">)</span>

<span class="token keyword">print</span> df<span class="token punctuation">.</span>groupby<span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">[</span><span class="token string">'subject'</span><span class="token punctuation">]</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">[</span><span class="token string">'subject'</span><span class="token punctuation">]</span><span class="token punctuation">.</span>agg<span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">[</span><span class="token string">'count'</span><span class="token punctuation">]</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span>
</code></pre></div>
<h2>2. How to build a full page vertical slider with vanilla JavaScript.</h2>
<p>Inspired by the <a href="http://bit.ly/tesla-website">tesla website</a>, I had to build a full page vertical slider. This deserves a tutorial on its own, but, basically:</p>
<ol>
<li>Wrap every one of your full page screens into a <code>div</code></li>
<li>Set a special class <code>.autoscroll-screen</code> to the div</li>
<li>Make sure these elements have a <code>height: 100vh</code> CSS property</li>
<li>Query the DOM for elements with class <code>.autoscroll-screen</code> and save the vertical separation between the top of each of these containers and the top of the document</li>
<li>Add an event listener to prevent scroll and catch the direction of the scroll</li>
<li>Animate <code>body</code> element <code>top</code> CSS property to match the top of the element that is requested by the user</li>
</ol>
<h2>3. How to better track my working hours.</h2>
<p>As a remote developer, not having to do straight 9 to 5 is such a relief. I'll do my 8 hours but most times I will spread these during my day. Sometimes this might be difficult to track. But I found a nice app called <a href="http://bit.ly/work-log">Work Log</a> that is just great. I can "punch in" whenever I start working and "punch out" when I stop, and it sums the full time for the day.</p>
<h2>4. How to check if your credentials have been pwned.</h2>
<p>Whenever some credentials breach occurs, all those e-mail addresses and passwords can be released to the public. For this reason, someone trying to brute-force a login will probably run all these passwords first before running any dictionary attack. Thus, using a common password is not a good idea, because if someone leaks their password, which happens to be the same as yours, someone could impersonate you. Even if you didn't leak your password.</p>
<p>In the website <a href="http://bit.ly/hibpwnedd">haveibeenpwned</a> you can check if your e-mail address was leaked in some attack. If so, please note that this doesn't mean that your password has also been leaked. To check for leaked passwords, the same page has a <a href="http://bit.ly/hibpasswords">pwned passwords search</a>.</p>
<p>But, if you are like me and don't trust to send your actual password to some service like this, you can use <a href="http://bit.ly/node-pwned-checker">this tool I built to check if you have been pwned locally</a>.</p>
<h2>5. How to drive a bigger motorbike.</h2>
<p>This month I finally got my 70hp license, yay! 🏍</p>
<h2>6. How to access flight information through an API.</h2>
<p>This cool travel company called Kiwi launched a platform called <a href="http://bit.ly/jp-tequila">Tequila</a>. They expose a nice API to get info on flights, hotels and other stuff for free.</p>
<p>This was the missing piece for a project that I will launch soon. Couldn't do it earlier because SkyScanner rejected my request for acces to their API...</p>
<h2>8. How to automate directory creation with BASH using {}.</h2>
<p>Say you want to create a directory called <code>src</code>.
Inside this directory you want 3 directories <code>pages</code>, <code>components</code> and <code>lib</code>.
Inside each of these directories you want to create 3 folders, <code>v1</code>, <code>v2</code> and <code>v3</code>.</p>
<div class="remark-highlight"><pre class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash">$ <span class="token function">mkdir</span> <span class="token parameter variable">-p</span> src/<span class="token punctuation">{</span>pages,components,lib<span class="token punctuation">}</span>/<span class="token punctuation">{</span>v1,v2,v3<span class="token punctuation">}</span>

<span class="token comment"># Results in this folder structure:</span>
<span class="token comment">#|-src</span>
<span class="token comment">#|---components</span>
<span class="token comment">#|-----v1</span>
<span class="token comment">#|-----v2</span>
<span class="token comment">#|-----v3</span>
<span class="token comment">#|---lib</span>
<span class="token comment">#|-----v1</span>
<span class="token comment">#|-----v2</span>
<span class="token comment">#|-----v3</span>
<span class="token comment">#|---pages</span>
<span class="token comment">#|-----v1</span>
<span class="token comment">#|-----v2</span>
<span class="token comment">#|-----v3</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Each word inside the <code>{}</code> will be an iteration.</p>
<p>Also you can do it with numbers, creating a range:</p>
<div class="remark-highlight"><pre class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash">$ <span class="token function">touch</span> foo_<span class="token punctuation">{</span><span class="token number">1</span><span class="token punctuation">..</span><span class="token number">5</span><span class="token punctuation">}</span>
$ <span class="token function">ls</span>
-<span class="token operator">></span> foo_1 foo_2 foo_3 foo_4 foo_5
</code></pre></div>
<h2>9. How to save on bed blankets.</h2>
<p>I moved to a new place recently and had to buy blankets and sheets. I got a nice set of bed sheets from Ikea for 48€. However, turns out that for that price I could get an even nicer set of bed sheets AND a big bed blanket in Primark... I didn't know they sell that there!</p>
<h2>10. How to build a slideshow / carousel / swiper.</h2>
<p>I thought that it would be easy peasy to do it myself... wrong! basic funcionality is easy but there are a number of edge cases: looping, auto playback, different animations... And let's not forget handling touch events.</p>
<p>In the end I gave up on reinventing the wheel and found a fantastic library called <a href="http://bit.ly/jpb-swiper">Swiper</a> that worked perfectly out of the box! not only that but it also had a myriad of customisations that made it so flexible. In the end I could adapt it perfectly to my requirements.</p>
<h2>11. How to negotiate like a professional.</h2>
<p>A colleague recommended this super interesting book called <a href="http://bit.ly/jpb-never-split-the-difference">Never Split The Difference</a>, and it got me hooked until the moment I finished it. It's written by an FBI hostage negotiator and provides techniques for improving your negotiations at your every day life, specially at work.</p>
<h2>12. How to track TODOs</h2>
<p>I heard in the <a href="http://bit.ly/jpb-syntax-podcast">Syntax podcast</a> about an app to track tasks for specific projects, it's really useful. It's called <a href="http://bit.ly/jpz-todoist">Todoist</a> and besides being multiplatform, its free tier is more than enough</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="./images/several-images-loor-nicolas.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>There are some cool wallpapers on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallpapers">r/wallpapers</a>. Earlier this year, I started saving them on a folder on my computer in order to display them on my desktop in a random fashion.</p>
<p>This picking and downloading process was kind of tedious, so I've built a small Node.js program to automate it.</p>
<p><a href="http://bit.ly/reddit-image-downloader-jonportella-website">🌄 The program is available here.</a></p>
<p>The way it works is very simple: It grabs the URL of the specified subreddit, adds some user defined variables and fetches it adding a <code>.json</code> extension.</p>
<p>It's so nice of Reddit to make things so easy by exposing the whole content of any page in JSON form by just adding a <code>.json</code> extension. E.G., <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallpapers/top">https://www.reddit.com/r/wallpapers/top</a> returns a normal page but <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallpapers/top.json">https://www.reddit.com/r/wallpapers/top.json</a> returns the whole content in JSON form.</p>
<p>After that, it is just a matter of finding and filtering the image URL in the JSON content and downloading it.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[A web app to make Instagram contests suck less.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="./images/i-loor-nicolas.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>So this friend of mine, who is a personal trainer, has a bussiness Instagram account. He did a contest where any follower could comment a picture of his to have a chance to win a pack of training equipment.</p>
<p>The comment needed to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Include the phrase 'I participate'.</li>
<li>Mention 3 other users.</li>
<li>Also, only one comment per user was allowed.</li>
</ul>
<p>A problem arised when, after more than 200 people commented, he had to, somehow, randomly pick a comment that also passed these conditions.</p>
<p>So I did a quick search for available options and I didn't find anything acceptable. Some were <a href="https://www.easypromosapp.com/instagram-sweepstakes/">paid services</a> and some other even required you to <a href="https://commentpicker.com/instagram.php">give them your credentials</a>... which doesn't make sense since pictures and comments are public unless the account is private. And I don't think many private accounts do contests adressed to gain more followers.</p>
<p>That's why I built a small app to solve this problem. It features a conversational UI to get the rules for a given contest and, at the last step, it creates a snippet that gets copied to the user clipboard. Then, this can be pasted in the JavaScript console in the picture page and the winner comment will be highlighted.</p>
<p><a href="/jon-portella-blog/free-instagram-random-comment-picker/">The app is available here.</a></p>
<p>In the future I might do a post about the decisions and the findings that features this little project. If I have to take one thing out of this is that conversational UI is super fun to work with!</p>
