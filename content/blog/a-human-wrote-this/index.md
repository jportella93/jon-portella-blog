Hey long time no write it’s been a while I’ve just been quite busy I guess since I joined Pinterest I haven’t really written anymore and that was like four years ago so so yeah the previous post it was an experiment just trying to one shot at an article on ChatGPT, as you can really tell by how it’s written it’s quite interesting how we moved away from the artisanal writing thing into more like LLM powered content machine, where basically everything that we write ends up being filtered out by the LLM and then probably scraped by another LLM and served in a different shape so I guess that’s what has made me want to come back and share my thoughts in a really natural way like I’m literally dictating this into a note and I’m just gonna push it so yeah stay tuned for more random updates maybe like I’ll talk about more software stuff who knows things change a lot
