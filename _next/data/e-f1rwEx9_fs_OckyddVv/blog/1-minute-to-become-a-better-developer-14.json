Customers get bored and don’t input their card details. How can we make it more engaging?</p>\n<p>Our boring static card.</p>\n<hr>\n<h4>A SOLUTION</h4>\n<p>We are going to use <a href=\"https://github.com/micku7zu/vanilla-tilt.js/\">Vanilla-tilt.js</a> to make our card move in 3 dimensions when hovering it with our mouse or tilting our handheld device.</p>\n<p>It is really simple:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Import it in our project</li>\n</ol>\n<div class=\"remark-highlight\"><pre class=\"language-unknown\"><code class=\"language-unknown\">npm install vanilla-tilt</code></pre></div>\n<p>or import it from a CDN as in the example:</p>\n<div class=\"remark-highlight\"><pre class=\"language-unknown\"><code class=\"language-unknown\">import vanillaTilt from &#x26;quot;https://cdn.skypack.dev/vanilla-tilt@1.7.0&#x26;quot;;</code></pre></div>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Target a DOM element as a Vanilla-tilt container. The second argument is the <a href=\"https://github.com/micku7zu/vanilla-tilt.js/#options\">options</a> object.</li>\n</ol>\n<div class=\"remark-highlight\"><pre class=\"language-unknown\"><code class=\"language-unknown\">const card = document.querySelector(&#x26;quot;#card&#x26;quot;);VanillaTilt.init(card, {  max: 10,  speed: 1000,  perspective: 700});</code></pre></div>\n<p>And that’s really it!
