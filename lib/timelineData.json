        "description": "What started out as a simple resume-like page, became an exhaustive timeline of my professional life and side projects. I compiled in a JSON file all the projects I've worked on, the jobs I've had, the studies I've done, and the personal projects I've worked on. Then I created some renderers to display them in a vertical timeline format. I did some iterations using a visualization library called vis-timeline, with more interactions animations etc, but the UX was not great on mobile, so I ended up creating a custom solution with UX first principles in mind. I structured with some overarching projects (University, main job at the time, etc) and nested projects I did during those periods. I took great care on adding demos to each project and links to where they can be tested (still some pending). Also added an automatic feed from the blog posts to the timeline, so it's always up to date with my writings. Finally, I added some links to each project card, so it's easy to share a particular point in the timeline with a link.",

The curriculum includes weekly problem sets drawing from real-world domains — such as cryptography, finance, forensics, biology or gaming — culminating in a final project that demonstrates the ability to design and implement a complete software application.\n\nCS50 emphasizes strong coding style, correctness, and algorithmic efficiency, helping learners develop not just coding fluency but deeper understanding of how computers work under the hood.
