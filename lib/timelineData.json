CS50 teaches core concepts including computational thinking, algorithms, data structures, abstraction, resource management, and software engineering principles.\n\nStudents gain practical programming experience in C, Python, SQL, JavaScript, HTML and CSS, progressing from low-level understanding of memory and machine-level concepts (via C) to higher-level web and application development skills (via Python, SQL, JavaScript, HTML/CSS). The curriculum includes weekly problem sets drawing from real-world domains — such as cryptography, finance, forensics, biology or gaming — culminating in a final project that demonstrates the ability to design and implement a complete software application.\n\nCS50 emphasizes strong coding style, correctness, and algorithmic efficiency, helping learners develop not just coding fluency but deeper understanding of how computers work under the hood. The course also connects students to a large global learning community, offering exposure to diverse problem-solving approaches and collaboration opportunities.",
