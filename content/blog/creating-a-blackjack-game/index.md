As the last test in order to get admitted in [Codeworks](https://codeworks.me/), the full stack JavaScript bootcamp I did back in 2018, I had one week to create and deliver a blackjack game.

I had some much fun doing it and though I might link it here, just in case someone wants to play :)

This is [the GitHub repo](https://github.com/jportella93/Blackjack) and the game can be played [here](https://jportella93.github.io/Blackjack/index.html).
