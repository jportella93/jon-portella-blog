Earlier this year, I started saving them on a folder on my computer in order to display them on my desktop in a random fashion.</p>\n<p>This picking and downloading process was kind of tedious, so I've built a small Node.js program to automate it.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://bit.ly/reddit-image-downloader-jonportella-website\">🌄 The program is available here.</a></p>\n<p>The way it works is very simple: It grabs the URL of the specified subreddit, adds some user defined variables and fetches it adding a <code>.json</code> extension.</p>\n<p>It's so nice of Reddit to make things so easy by exposing the whole content of any page in JSON form by just adding a <code>.json</code> extension. E.G., <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallpapers/top\">https://www.reddit.com/r/wallpapers/top</a> returns a normal page but <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallpapers/top.json\">https://www.reddit.com/r/wallpapers/top.json</a> returns the whole content in JSON form.</p>\n<p>After that, it is just a matter of finding and filtering the image URL in the JSON content and downloading it.</p>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Downloading Reddit Images in Bulk","spoiler":"Get all the neat desktop goodness from /r/wallpapers with this command line utility built in Node.js","date":"2019-01-29T15:12:03.284Z"}},"previous":{"slug":"picking-random-comments-on-instagram","frontmatter":{"title":"Picking Random Comments On Instagram","spoiler":"A web app to make Instagram contests suck less.","date":"2019-01-15T15:12:03.284Z"}},"next":{"slug":"12-things-i-learned-in-march-2019","frontmatter":{"title":"12 Things I Learned in March 2019","spoiler":"Tips and tricks including but not limited to Pandas, JavaScript sliders and swipers, a flights API, BASH automations and some other nifty ideas.","date":"2019-03-31T19:38:03.284Z"}}},"__N_SSG":true}
