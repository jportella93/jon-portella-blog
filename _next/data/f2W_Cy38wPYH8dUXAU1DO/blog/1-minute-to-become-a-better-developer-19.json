However, that would also target the <code>src</code> tag of the first image, since, <strong>by default, RegEx quantifiers aregreedy</strong>, so we are capturing until the last occurrence of <code>“</code> in the line.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/content/blog/1-minute-to-become-a-better-developer-19/images/2.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>We wrongly target the src tag of the first image.</p>\n<p>How can we do it?</p>\n<h4>A SOLUTION</h4>\n<p>We are going to use a **RegEx Lazy (or Non-Greedy) Quantifier **to match only the alt tags and add them back with a full stop.</p>\n<p>We only need to add a <code>?</code> after the quantifier.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/content/blog/1-minute-to-become-a-better-developer-19/images/3.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Lazy Quantifier allows us to only target the alt tag.</p>\n<p>Here’s a demo on CodePen.
