Now you need to start over with them…</p>\n<h3>A SOLUTION</h3>\n<p>To save you this headache, I’m sharing my super-useful custom alias for updating my shell config that does the following:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Opens your shell config file.</li>\n<li>Saves a copy of the updated file on a secret <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/\">Github Gist</a>.</li>\n<li>Refreshes your shell session so you can use the updated command right away.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Let’s set it up.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This tutorial assumes you’re using <a href=\"https://www.zsh.org/\">zsh</a>. If your are using <a href=\"https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/\">bash</a>, just replace <code>zsh</code> and <code>.zshrc</code> by <code>bash</code> and <code>.bashrc</code> in the next commands. You can find out which shell you’re using by running <code>echo $0</code> .</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ol>\n<li>Let’s create a secret <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/\">gist</a> where our config will be saved:</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Creating a secret <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/\">Gist</a>.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>\n<p>Copy the Gist identifier from the URL, the last part. In my case the URL is <code>https://gist.github.com/jportella93/616c872593daf91781d6842c9829b1f0</code> so I’m copying <code>616c872593daf91781d6842c9829b1f0</code> .</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In your <code>~/.zshrc</code> include this line:</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<div class=\"remark-highlight\"><pre class=\"language-unknown\"><code class=\"language-unknown\">alias zshrc=&#x26;quot;gedit ~/.zshrc &#x26;amp;&#x26;amp; gist-paste -u 616c872593daf91781d6842c9829b1f0 ~/.zshrc &#x26;amp;&#x26;amp; exec zsh&#x26;quot;</code></pre></div>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I’m using <code>gedit</code> as text editor but you can use any other like <code>nano</code>, <code>vim</code> or <code>code</code> . Then replace the gist identifier <code>616c872593daf91781d6842c9829b1f0</code> with the one you copied in the previous step.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>If you haven’t already, install <a href=\"https://github.com/defunkt/gist\">gist</a> to be able to interact with Github Gist from the CLI, in this article I explain how to do it quickly:</li>\n</ol>\n<p>[</p>\n<h2>1 Minute To Become A Better Developer (#7)</h2>\n<h3>Welcome to issue #7 of this series, where you become a more successful developer by reading short nuggets of knowledge…</h3>\n<p>jportella93.medium.com\n](https://jportella93.medium.com/1-minute-to-become-a-better-developer-7-6c9c9fa67a9c?sourcepost_page-----43ce61662d72---------------------------------------)</p>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li>Now you’re all set! When you want to update an alias in your <code>~/.zshrc</code> just type <code>zshrc</code> in your CLI, make changes on your text editor, and changes will be backed up on the Gist automatically. Moreover, you’ll be able to use your updated alias right away!
