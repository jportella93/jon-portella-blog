The design shows a nice layout where all lines take the same space.</p>\n<p>Easy enough, you implement the design and release it into the wild. But then you realize that this UI can break with a person with a longer name.</p>\n<p>That’s because the data being shown has <strong>variable length</strong> and you should account for all the cases where it will be used. <a href=\"https://www.jonportella.com/displaying-data-with-variable-length-example#example-1\">Here is a demo with the example.</a></p>\n<p>There will be users with super long names, e-mail addresses, and what not and this shouldn’t break your UI.</p>\n<h2>THE SOLUTION</h2>\n<p>One approach to prevent this would be to create a wrapper component for variable length text which is expected to be shown in a single line. All overflowing text can be scrolled to the side if needed.</p>\n<h3><em>OneLineScroller.jsx</em></h3>\n<p>Wrapping your text fields with this component makes them span exactly one line. <a href=\"https://www.jonportella.com/displaying-data-with-variable-length-example#example-2\">Check example #2 with the OneLineScroller</a>.</p>\n<p>Thanks for reading!
