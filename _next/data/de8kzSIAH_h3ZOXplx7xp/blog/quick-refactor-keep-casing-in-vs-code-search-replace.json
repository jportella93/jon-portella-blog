We are saving a reference to the old value that the key <code>name</code> pointed to for logging purposes.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/content/blog/quick-refactor-keep-casing-in-vs-code-search-replace/images/1.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Now we realize that we’d like to rename the key <code>name</code> to <code>alias</code>. A refactoring is in order. So we pull up the find and replace feature by pressing ctrl/cmd + f.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/content/blog/quick-refactor-keep-casing-in-vs-code-search-replace/images/2.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>But oops! as they key <code>name</code> is also used in camelCase as part of other variables names <code>newPetName</code> and <code>oldPetName</code> , we get a casing mismatch after replacing. <code>newPetalias</code> and <code>oldPetalias</code> don’t look so good…</p>\n<p><img src=\"/content/blog/quick-refactor-keep-casing-in-vs-code-search-replace/images/3.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<h4>A SOLUTION</h4>\n<p>We are going to undo this change and repeat it using the <a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/codebasics#_advanced-find-and-replace-options\">preserve case option on the find and replace feature</a> by pressing the <code>AB</code> button.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/content/blog/quick-refactor-keep-casing-in-vs-code-search-replace/images/4.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Now we’ve saved time refactoring and our pets are happy with their aliases!</p>\n<p><img src=\"/content/blog/quick-refactor-keep-casing-in-vs-code-search-replace/images/5.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<hr>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Quick Refactor: Keep Casing in VSCode Search + Replace","spoiler":"A simple Visual Studio Code trick to save precious time while refactoring","date":"2021-02-25T13:32:08.096Z"}},"previous":{"slug":"persist-css-changes-done-in-chrome-s-dev-tools","frontmatter":{"title":"Persist CSS Changes Done in Chrome’s Dev-Tools","spoiler":"Avoid losing all those changes on the elements tab if you accidentally reload your browser","date":"2021-02-24T13:38:12.609Z"}},"next":{"slug":"quick-async-one-liners-with-async-immediately-invoked-function-expressions","frontmatter":{"title":"Quick Async One-Liners With Async Immediately Invoked Function Expressions","spoiler":"A neat trick for a job interview or to save time on quick scripts","date":"2021-02-26T12:35:22.653Z"}}},"__N_SSG":true}
