Just replacing <code>http</code> for <code>https</code> results in undesired <code>httpss</code> .</p>\n<p>Just replacing <code>http for https produces httpss.</code></p>\n<p>So we only want to match and update <code>http</code> that is not followed by an <code>s</code> . How do we do that?</p>\n<h4>A SOLUTION</h4>\n<p>Enter <strong>Regex’s Negative Lookahead</strong>. The syntax is simple:</p>\n<div class=\"remark-highlight\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">http(?!s)</code></pre></div>\n<p>Where:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The parentheses followed by a question mark and exclamation point <code>(?!)</code> is the construct for the Negative Lookahead.</li>\n<li>Characters between the exclamation point and the closing parentheses are the ones negated. In this case, we are only negating the character <code>s</code> .</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here’s a demo on <a href=\"http://regexr.com/5o95i\">RegExr</a>.</p>\n<p>So our solution would be:</p>\n<p>Using Regex’s Negative Lookahead, we can match http and not https.</p>\n<hr>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Using Regex Negative Lookahead to Replace HTTP with HTTPS","spoiler":"Learn how to use Regex’s Negative Lookahead, in one minute.","date":"2021-03-09T13:51:16.857Z"}},"previous":{"slug":"how-to-use-a-vpn-to-change-your-public-ip-address-from-the-command-line","frontmatter":{"title":"How To Use a VPN to Change Your Public IP Address From the Command Line","spoiler":"A tutorial on setting a VPN and using it from the CLI to hide our IP and location","date":"2021-03-08T14:03:39.417Z"}},"next":{"slug":"track-user-scroll-with-intersectionobserver","frontmatter":{"title":"Track User Scroll with IntersectionObserver","spoiler":"Learn how to leverage window.IntersectionObserver to find out how many visitors see your content, in one minute.","date":"2021-03-10T13:32:36.932Z"}}},"__N_SSG":true}
